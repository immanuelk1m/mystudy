    "summary": "This text explains market disequilibrium conditions, specifically excess supply (surplus) and excess demand (shortage), and how market forces drive prices back towards equilibrium. When there's excess supply (price above equilibrium), producers face unsold goods, leading to price cuts. When there's excess demand (price below equilibrium), consumers face shortages, prompting producers to raise prices. The document defines equilibrium as a state of balance where there's no pressure for price or quantity to change, and references Alfred Marshall's analogy of supply and demand working together like scissor blades.",
