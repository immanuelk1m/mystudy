Projection every element of X \nto exactly one element of Y .\n• Denotation : 𝑦 = 𝐹(𝑥)\n• Examples\n1. y = 𝑥 + 10\n2. y = 2𝑥𝛼 \n• Illustrating a function is helpful to sketch the characteristic of the function.

    "summary": "This text introduces the concept of the production function as an alternative to production tables for analyzing production cost, emphasizing its common assumption of diminishing marginal product. It then prepares the reader by reviewing fundamental mathematical concepts: functions (definition, denotation, illustration, and slope), and differentiation (meaning, denotations, and key formulas like constant rule, power rule, and sum rule). The text concludes by presenting an example of a specific production function for a hypothetical business to illustrate these concepts.",
