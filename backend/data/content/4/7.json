    "summary": "This document explains the relationship between output and cost, focusing on how diminishing marginal products lead to increasing costs per additional unit of output. It defines four key cost concepts: Average Fixed Cost (AFC), Average Variable Cost (AVC), Average Total Cost (ATC), and Marginal Cost (MC), providing their formulas. The text also elaborates on the crucial relationship between Marginal Cost and Average Total Cost, illustrating how MC influences the movement of ATC. Finally, it presents a set of practice problems for deriving various cost functions from a given production function.",
