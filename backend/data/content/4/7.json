In the short run, we can classify the \ncosts into fixed costs and variable costs.\n◦ Fixed costs are the costs that cannot be changed in the short run.\n◦ Variable costs are the costs that can be changed.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of \nproduction, at least not in the short term.\n◦ For example, the cost of building factory or buying heavy equipment, research and \ndevelopment costs, advertising expenses. \n◦ The level of fixed costs varies according to the feature of the products or \nindustry. \n◦ For instance, manufacturing mobile phone or computer chips requires an \nexpensive factory. But, a food-truck or a painting artist can get by with \nrelatively less fixed costs.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Variable costs are incurred in the act of producing.\n◦ For example, wages and cost to buy intermediate goods are variable costs.\n◦ The more you produce, the greater the variable cost.\n◦ Total cost = fixed cost + variable cost.\nThe nature of production\n◦ Two assumptions:\n1. Positivity (with respect to input)\n2. Law of diminishing marginal production\n◦ Marginal product of any input : the additional quantity of output obtained \nfrom one additional unit of that input."

    "summary": "This lecture introduces the producer's optimization problem within a market economy, focusing on how individual firms make choices. It defines the business objective as profit (Revenue - Cost) and breaks down revenue (Price × Quantity) and total cost. A key distinction is made between fixed costs (unchangeable in the short run, like factory buildings or R&D, varying by industry) and variable costs (changeable, like wages or raw materials). The text explains that total cost is the sum of fixed and variable costs and briefly touches upon the nature of production, including the law of diminishing marginal production and the concept of marginal product.",
