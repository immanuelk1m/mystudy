    "summary": "This text outlines a practice problem for deriving various cost functions based on a given production function `Q = 2 X^(1/2)`. It specifies a fixed cost of 100 and an input price of 10, then tasks the user with deriving equations for total cost (to input and output), average fixed cost, average variable cost, average total cost, and marginal cost (to output).",
