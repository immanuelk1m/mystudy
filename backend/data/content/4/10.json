    "summary": "This text introduces the producer's optimization problem, focusing on profit maximization defined as Revenue minus Cost. It elaborates on production costs (fixed, variable, total, and marginal) and revenue (total and marginal). Using an example where production is Q = 10X^(1/2) and price is fixed at 10, the text illustrates how to derive production cost and marginal cost functions, and how marginal revenue equals price. The core rule for profit maximization, where Marginal Revenue equals Marginal Cost (MR=MC), is explained and applied to the example, determining an optimal production quantity of 10. Finally, it discusses the relationship between output and cost, highlighting how diminishing marginal products lead to increasing marginal costs.",
