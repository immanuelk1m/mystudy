Therefore, the overall housing demand in a country can also peak when the number of middle-aged individuals reaches its highest level.

Demand for housing is not solely determined by preferences but also by expectations of capital gains (i.e., the expectation that the property's value will increase).

    "summary": "This document explains the non-price factors that cause shifts in market demand and supply curves. For demand, it details how changes in consumer income (distinguishing between normal, inferior, and luxury goods), tastes/preferences, demographic shifts, and future expectations can lead to a shift. For supply, it outlines how changes in production costs, new technologies, and government policies (taxes, regulations, and subsidies) can cause the supply curve to shift.",
