It \nwill go down a little.\n◦ But, If the 11th record was larger than the former average, \nsuch as 11 seconds, average record with the additional record \nwould rise.\nThe structure of production cost\n: the relationship between ATC and MC\n◦ The ATV has the similar concept with the average record, and \nMC is a concept similar to the 11th new record.\n◦ Average total cost is somewhat cumulative cost, while marginal \ncost is  the additional cost.\n◦ Average total cost become larger and smaller if the marginal \ncost is larger and smaller than the average total cost.\nThe structure of production cost\n: the relationship between ATC and MC\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30\nMC ATC"

  "aiNotes": {
    "summary": "The text outlines the structure of production costs, defining four key concepts: Average Fixed Cost (AFC), Average Variable Cost (AVC), Average Total Cost (ATC), and Marginal Cost (MC). AFC is fixed cost divided by output, AVC is variable cost divided by output, and ATC is total cost divided by output. Marginal Cost is the additional cost incurred from producing one more unit of output. The text also explains the relationship between Marginal Cost and Average Total Cost, illustrating that ATC falls when MC is below it and rises when MC is above it, analogous to how an individual record affects an average.",
