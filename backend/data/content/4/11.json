    "summary": "This text introduces price controls as government-enacted laws to regulate market prices, often in response to public pressure. It defines two main types: price ceilings, which prevent prices from rising above a certain level, and price floors (also known as price supports), which prevent prices from falling below a certain level. The document emphasizes that while intended to address price concerns, these controls, when analyzed through the demand and supply model, often lead to undesirable consequences. It concludes by suggesting that alternative policy tools might achieve similar goals with fewer costs and tradeoffs.",
