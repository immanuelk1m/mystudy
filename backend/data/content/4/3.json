    "summary": "This text outlines key economic concepts related to consumer demand, focusing on how income and price changes, as well as relationships between goods, influence demand. It defines the income effect and categorizes goods into normal, inferior, and luxury based on their response to income changes. The document also explains the substitution and income effects of a price change, introduces the general price effect and the special case of Giffen goods. Finally, it details the relationships between substitute and complementary goods and how price changes in one affect the demand for the other, culminating in a definition of the demand curve and quantity demanded.",
