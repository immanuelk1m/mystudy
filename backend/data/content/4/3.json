Utility\n• People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility from using those goods and services.\n• Utility is the term which economists use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction/usefulness or \nhappiness with his or her choices.\n• Of course, in our daily life, we don’t measure such a thing. But, in model, it can be a quite useful \ninstrument to replicate the underlying incentive structure of each individuals.\n2. Utility\nEconomists assume the feature of utility\n1.The more of some good one consumes, the more utility \none obtains.\n2. As a person consumes more of a good, the additional (or \nmarginal) utility from each additional unit of the good \ndeclines.\n2. Utility\n• It is a general pattern that consumption of the first few units of good tends to bring a higher level of \nutility than consumption of later units.\n• Suppose that you are in thirsty. You can compare the degree to which the first few drops of water relieve \nthe thirst and the extent to which the drinking water later resolves the thirst.\n• Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility.\n• It means that, the utility of a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more \nthan the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.\n2. Utility\n• The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing \nchoices. \n• Most of people would not say, “My favorite food is potato, so I will eat nothing but only potatoes from \nnow on.”\n• Even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the marginal \nutility from those last few servings would not be very high. \n2. Utility\n• An example for the marginal utilities for meal ticket (and shirt):\n𝑀𝑈𝑀 = 1\n𝑀\n𝑀𝑈𝑆 = 1\n𝑆"

    "summary": "In economics, utility is defined as the level of satisfaction or happiness a person derives from consuming goods and services. Economists assume that while total utility increases with consumption, the additional utility gained from each subsequent unit (marginal utility) diminishes. This concept, known as the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility, explains why individuals rarely make all-or-nothing choices, as the satisfaction from consuming more units of the same good eventually decreases, even for highly desired items.",
