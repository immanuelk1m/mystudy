For \nexample, if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n, he/she will choose X.\n• Note that the marginal utility of one good decreases as he/she consume more. If he/she consume X more \nand more, \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n. In that case, he/she can get more utility by getting more Y and giving up some X.\n• That means, if he/she is rational, he/she will stick to the condition,\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n= \n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\nMarginal analysis\n: The rule of maximization\n• If there are other goods (which means, in more general terms),\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n= \n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n= ⋯ = \n𝑴𝑼𝒁\n𝑷𝒁\n.\n• The rule of maximization captures several important characteristics of consumers in market economy.\n• The relationship among consumptions on different items.\n• The effect of price change\n• The effect of income change\n• How the shape of marginal utilities affect consumption plan (and how the consumption plan responses to income/price change)?"

    "summary": "This text explains marginal analysis as a method for making optimal consumption choices by evaluating tradeoffs in terms of marginal utility per spending. It defines marginal utility as the additional utility from consuming one more unit of a good and introduces 'marginal utility per spending' (Marginal Utility / Price) as the key metric for comparison. The core principle, known as the rule of maximization, states that optimal choice occurs when the marginal utility per spending is equal across all goods (MUx/Px = MUy/Py = ...). This equality is achieved because rational consumers will reallocate spending from goods with lower MU/P to those with higher MU/P until the ratios equalize, driven by the concept of diminishing marginal utility. This rule helps explain consumer behavior, including how consumption plans relate to different items and how they respond to changes in price and income.",
