    "summary": "This chapter introduces the producer's optimization problem, focusing on how firms maximize profit. It defines profit as revenue minus total cost, breaking down costs into fixed and variable components. The text explains the nature of production, including the law of diminishing marginal production, where adding more of one input eventually yields smaller increases in output. Through the example of 'Pepe's chicken house,' it illustrates the calculation of total cost, fixed cost, variable cost, and revenue, setting the foundation for determining a firm's optimal production level by comparing marginal costs and marginal revenues.",
