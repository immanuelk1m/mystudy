    "summary": "This text introduces the concept of the 'consumer problem' in economics, focusing on budget constraints and opportunity cost. It uses a simplified model with a representative consumer, Pepe, to illustrate how limited income and prices of goods (meal tickets and shirts) define what a consumer can afford. The budget constraint line shows the combinations of goods that can be purchased, with its slope representing the relative price and opportunity cost. The document explains how changes in prices or income affect the budget constraint, leading to shifts or changes in slope, and emphasizes that every economic choice involves an opportunity cost.",
