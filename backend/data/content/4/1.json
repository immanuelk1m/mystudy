    "summary": "This lecture, 'Lecture 2: Consumer Problem,' introduces how individual consumers make choices within a market economy. It aims to explain consumer behavior through economic modeling, covering key concepts such as budget constraints, opportunity cost, utility, and marginal utility. The core objective is to solve the consumer's optimization problem using marginal analysis, understand optimal consumption decisions, and ultimately derive a demand curve. The lecture structure includes describing the consumer choice model (choices, objectives, rational behavior), maximizing utility subject to budget constraints, and the derivation of the demand curve.",
