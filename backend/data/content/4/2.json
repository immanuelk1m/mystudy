      "content": "1. Budget Constraint\n• Suppose there is a consumer whose name is Pepe. He is the representative agent of all customers in our \nsociety.\n\n1. Budget Constraint\n• We want to capture that consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and \nwant.\n• Pepe has 5,600 wons in spending money each week.\n• He can allocate this spending between meal ticket and shirts. \n• The meal tickets cost 700 wons each, and the shirts are 1,400 wons each.\n\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Of course, the budget constraint diagram containing just two goods is not realistic. \n• Because, in a modern economy, people choose from thousands of goods.\n• However, thinking about a model with many goods can be just a straightforward extension of what we \ndiscussed here.\n• The point is that there is always a trade-off problem in decisions.\n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket\n8\n4\n• Each point on the line of \nbudget constraint \nrepresents a combination \nof meal tickets and shirts, \nwhich the total cost adds \nup to Pepe’s budget of \n5,600 won. \nClothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• If he spend out his budget, we can \nthink his budget constraint is actually \nthe outer line of the colored area.\n• If he had unlimited income or goods \nwere free, then he could consume \nwithout limit.  \n• Any point outside the constraint is \nnot affordable, because it would cost \nmore money than Pepe has in his \nbudget.\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• It just means that,\n𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒.\n• In this case,\n• Income = 5,600 wons\n• Expenditure = 700 M + 1,400 S\n• So, 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• To draw it in a 2-D plane,\n➢5600 = 700M + 1400S\n➢700M = 5600 – 1400S\n➢M = 8 – 2S\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• The slope of the budget constraint is \ndetermined by the relative price. \n• Relative price - How many meal \ntickets would Pepe have to give up to \nget one more shirt, while staying \nwithin his budget?\n• All along the budget set, getting 1 \nshirt means giving up 2 meal tickets.\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Economists call it opportunity cost.\n• Opportunity cost indicate what have to be given up to obtain something. In other words, opportunity cost \nis the value of the next best alternative.\n• For Pepe, the opportunity cost of 1 shirt is the 2 meal tickets. \n• He would decide to buy one more shirt, If the value of the extra shirt exceed the value of the alternative \n(2 meal tickets).\n1. Budget Constraint\n• A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost.\n• If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost might be the time which would be spent \nto make up the class.\n• If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. \n• In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price.\n• For example, attending graduate school is the case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. \nThe explicit costs of attending college might be about tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. \nBut in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a \npaying job. Thus, graduate school imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost \nearnings.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if the price of a good changes?\n• Suppose that, the price of bus ticket increased to 1,400 won.\n• A price increase for bus tickets would have no effect on the ability to purchase Ramen. \n• But it would reduce the number of bus tickets which Pepe could afford to buy.\n• What happens in the budget constraint? Redraw it. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if Pepe’s income changes?\n• Suppose that, his income drops as a half(=2,800 won).\n• In this case, it would reduce the number of both of meal tickets and shirts which Pepe could afford to buy. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n4\n2\n1. Budget Constraint\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4"

    "summary": "The text explains the concept of a budget constraint, illustrating how consumers, like Pepe with his 5,600 won weekly income, face limitations in purchasing goods and services. It demonstrates that the budget constraint line represents all combinations of goods (e.g., meal tickets and shirts) that can be afforded within a given income, with points inside being affordable and outside unaffordable. The slope of this line reflects the relative price of goods and, more importantly, the opportunity cost—the value of the next best alternative forgone (e.g., 2 meal tickets for 1 shirt). The text emphasizes that every choice has an opportunity cost, which can sometimes exceed monetary costs. Finally, it shows how changes in the price of a good pivot the budget constraint, while changes in income cause a parallel shift of the entire budget line.",
