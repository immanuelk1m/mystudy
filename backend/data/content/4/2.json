This law implies that the utility a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more than the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.",

Conversely, if 𝑀𝑈𝑋/𝑃𝑋 < 𝑀𝑈𝑌/𝑃𝑌, they can benefit from consuming more Y and less X. As a consumer consumes more of a good, its marginal utility decreases, eventually leading to a point where the marginal utility per spending for both goods becomes equal.",

    "summary": "This document introduces the economic concept of utility, defining it as the satisfaction or happiness derived from consuming goods and services. It explains the two key assumptions about utility: more consumption generally leads to more utility, but crucially, the additional utility from each subsequent unit of a good declines, a principle known as the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility. This law helps explain why consumers diversify their choices rather than making 'all-or-nothing' decisions. The text then delves into marginal analysis, introducing 'marginal utility per spending' (marginal utility divided by price) as a tool for comparing different goods. It culminates in the 'Rule of Maximization' (or consumer optimization rule), stating that consumers achieve maximum utility when the marginal utility per dollar spent is equal across all goods. This rule is then extended to multiple goods and its implications for understanding consumer behavior in response to price and income changes are highlighted, followed by an illustrative example.",
