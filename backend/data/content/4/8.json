    "summary": "The provided text introduces fundamental economic concepts of market equilibrium, demand, and supply. It defines demand as consumers' willingness and ability to purchase goods/services at various prices, distinguishing it from quantity demanded (a specific amount at one price). It explains the 'law of demand' as the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded, assuming other factors are constant. The text also defines quantity supplied as producers' willingness to supply at different prices, noting a direct relationship between price and quantity supplied, and describes the general downward slope of demand curves and upward slope of supply curves.",
