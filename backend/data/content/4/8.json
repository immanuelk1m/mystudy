    "summary": "The text uses 'Pepe's chicken house' as an example to illustrate fundamental economic concepts related to production. It defines fixed costs (e.g., 100 for space/equipment) and variable costs (e.g., 50 per worker), showing how total costs are derived. The example demonstrates the law of diminishing marginal production, where adding more labor eventually yields smaller increases in output. It then calculates total and additional revenue based on a fixed price per chicken. By comparing the additional cost (marginal cost) and additional revenue (marginal revenue) for each worker, the text implicitly guides towards the optimal production choice, aligning with the principle of equating marginal revenue to marginal cost (MR = MC).",
