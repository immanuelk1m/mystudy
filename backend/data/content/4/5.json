    "summary": "The text analyzes consumer behavior using 'Pepe's optimal choice' as an example, demonstrating how to determine an optimal choice given a budget constraint and utility function. It explores the income effect, categorizing goods as normal, inferior, or luxury based on how demand changes with income. Furthermore, it details the price effect, explaining it as a combination of the substitution effect (change in relative price) and the income effect (change in real purchasing power), while also mentioning Giffen goods as a special case. Finally, it discusses the relationship between goods, defining substitute and complementary goods and how price changes in one affect the demand for the other.",
