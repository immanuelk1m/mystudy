Maximization of the objective under the constraint (rationality)\n2. Maximization of the utility subject to the budget constraint\n•  Marginal analysis\n3.  Derivation of a demand curve\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Suppose there is a consumer whose name is Pepe. He is the representative agent of all customers in our \nsociety.\n\n1. Budget Constraint\n• We want to capture that consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and \nwant.\n• Pepe has 5,600 wons in spending money each week.\n• He can allocate this spending between meal ticket and shirts. \n• The meal tickets cost 700 wons each, and the shirts are 1,400 wons each.\n\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Of course, the budget constraint diagram containing just two goods is not realistic. \n• Because, in a modern economy, people choose from thousands of goods.\n• However, thinking about a model with many goods can be just a straightforward extension of what we \ndiscussed here.\n• The point is that there is always a trade-off problem in decisions.\n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket\n8\n4\n• Each point on the line of \nbudget constraint \nrepresents a combination \nof meal tickets and shirts, \nwhich the total cost adds \nup to Pepe’s budget of \n5,600 won. \nClothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• If he spend out his budget, we can \nthink his budget constraint is actually \nthe outer line of the colored area.\n• If he had unlimited income or goods \nwere free, then he could consume \nwithout limit.  \n• Any point outside the constraint is \nnot affordable, because it would cost \nmore money than Pepe has in his \nbudget.\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• It just means that,\n𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒.\n• In this case,\n• Income = 5,600 wons\n• Expenditure = 700 M + 1,400 S\n• So, 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• To draw it in a 2-D plane,\n➢5600 = 700M + 1400S\n➢700M = 5600 – 1400S\n➢M = 8 – 2S\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• The slope of the budget constraint is \ndetermined by the relative price. \n• Relative price - How many meal \ntickets would Pepe have to give up to \nget one more shirt, while staying \nwithin his budget?\n• All along the budget set, getting 1 \nshirt means giving up 2 meal tickets.\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Economists call it opportunity cost.\n• Opportunity cost indicate what have to be given up to obtain something. In other words, opportunity cost \nis the value of the next best alternative.\n• For Pepe, the opportunity cost of 1 shirt is the 2 meal tickets. \n• He would decide to buy one more shirt, If the value of the extra shirt exceed the value of the alternative \n(2 meal tickets).\n1. Budget Constraint\n• A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost.\n• If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost might be the time which would be spent \nto make up the class.\n• If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. \n• In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price.\n• For example, attending graduate school is the case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. \nThe explicit costs of attending college might be about tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. \nBut in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a \npaying job. Thus, graduate school imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost \nearnings.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if the price of a good changes?\n• Suppose that, the price of bus ticket increased to 1,400 won.\n• A price increase for bus tickets would have no effect on the ability to purchase Ramen. \n• But it would reduce the number of bus tickets which Pepe could afford to buy.\n• What happens in the budget constraint? Redraw it. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if Pepe’s income changes?\n• Suppose that, his income drops as a half(=2,800 won).\n• In this case, it would reduce the number of both of meal tickets and shirts which Pepe could afford to buy. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n4\n2\n1. Budget Constraint\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n2. Utility\n• People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility from using those goods and services.\n• Utility is the term which economists use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction/usefulness or \nhappiness with his or her choices.\n• Of course, in our daily life, we don’t measure such a thing. But, in model, it can be a quite useful \ninstrument to replicate the underlying incentive structure of each individuals.\n2. Utility\nEconomists assume the feature of utility\n1.The more of some good one consumes, the more utility \none obtains.\n2. As a person consumes more of a good, the additional (or \nmarginal) utility from each additional unit of the good \ndeclines.\n2. Utility\n• It is a general pattern that consumption of the first few units of good tends to bring a higher level of \nutility than consumption of later units.\n• Suppose that you are in thirsty. You can compare the degree to which the first few drops of water relieve \nthe thirst and the extent to which the drinking water later resolves the thirst.\n• Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility.\n• It means that, the utility of a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more \nthan the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.\n2. Utility\n• The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing \nchoices. \n• Most of people would not say, “My favorite food is potato, so I will eat nothing but only potatoes from \nnow on.”\n• Even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the marginal \nutility from those last few servings would not be very high. \n2. Utility\n• An example for the marginal utilities for meal ticket (and shirt):\n𝑀𝑈𝑀 = 1\n𝑀\n𝑀𝑈𝑆 = 1\n𝑆\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n• The marginal approach is based on looking at the tradeoffs(measured in terms of marginal utility per \nspending) of consuming less of one good and more of another.\n• Marginal utility of X = additional utility from consuming 1 more unit (the smallest unit we can imagine) \nof X\n• Which decision is better? Check the marginal utilities.\n• But we have to consider that the prices are different.\n• Relative price indicates how much unit of Y can be exchanged with 1 more X.\n• Marginal utility per spending of X = marginal utility of X / price of X\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 1\n• Which decision is better? Comparing the marginal utilities per spending.\n• Suppose an initial state of X,Y . What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n>\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ? Can he/she better off (by changing in decision for \nX,Y)? Yes. Suppose that he/she get more X by giving up some Y . \n• What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n<\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ?\n• After all adjustments, we derive the rule of maximization \n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\n• Note that there is no incentive to deviate from the equality condition.\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 2\n• Suppose that he/she starts to spend money from 0.\n• To make the best decision, he/she would choose the plan with a higher marginal utility per spending. For \nexample, if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n>\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n, he/she will choose X.\n• Note that the marginal utility of one good decreases as he/she consume more. If he/she consume X more \nand more, \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n<\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n. In that case, he/she can get more utility by getting more Y and giving up some X.\n• That means, if he/she is rational, he/she will stick to the condition,\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\nMarginal analysis\n: The rule of maximization\n• If there are other goods (which means, in more general terms),\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n= ⋯ =\n𝑴𝑼𝒁\n𝑷𝒁\n.\n• The rule of maximization captures several important characteristics of consumers in market economy.\n• The relationship among consumptions on different items.\n• The effect of price change\n• The effect of income change\n• How the shape of marginal utilities affect consumption plan (and how the consumption plan responses to income/price change)?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Budget constraint : 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nUtility function : 𝑀𝑈𝑀 =\n1\n𝑀, 𝑀𝑈𝑆 =\n1\n𝑆\n• What is the optimal choice for M, S?\n\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Now, let’s suppose that the income goes up to 11,200 won.\n\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nIncome effect\n• Income effect and the characteristics of good\n• Normal goods : an increase in income causes an increase in demand (+)\n• Inferior goods : an increase in income causes a decrease in demand (-)\n• Luxury goods : an increase in income causes a bigger percentage increase in demand (++)\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• What if the price of M goes to 1400 won ?\n\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• If the price of S falls to 700 won ?\n\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 8 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n8\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• When a price changes,\n• Substitution effect : change in relative price (the slope in budget constraint)\n• Income effect (of a price change) : shift in real purchasing power\n\nPrice effect\n• Price effect : an increase in price causes an decrease in demand (-)\n* Special case : Giffen goods – price effect (+)\n• Relationship between goods\n• Substitute goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\n• Complementary goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• Then, consider price effect on other good\n• On substitute goods : an increase in the price of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• On complementary goods : an increase in the price of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\nDemand curve\n• What is demand curve? The relationship between price and quantity demanded\n• What is the quantity demanded? We know what occurs if consumers follow their self-interest. => The \noptimal decision of consumption\n• Remind that price effect is negative (-).\nThanks!!"

In the short run, we can classify the \ncosts into fixed costs and variable costs.\n◦ Fixed costs are the costs that cannot be changed in the short run.\n◦ Variable costs are the costs that can be changed.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of \nproduction, at least not in the short term.\n◦ For example, the cost of building factory or buying heavy equipment, research and \ndevelopment costs, advertising expenses. \n◦ The level of fixed costs varies according to the feature of the products or \nindustry. \n◦ For instance, manufacturing mobile phone or computer chips requires an \nexpensive factory. But, a food-truck or a painting artist can get by with \nrelatively less fixed costs.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Variable costs are incurred in the act of producing.\n◦ For example, wages and cost to buy intermediate goods are variable costs.\n◦ The more you produce, the greater the variable cost.\n◦ Total cost = fixed cost + variable cost.\nThe nature of production\n◦ Two assumptions:\n1. Positivity (with respect to input)\n2. Law of diminishing marginal production\n◦ Marginal product of any input : the additional quantity of output obtained \nfrom one additional unit of that input.\nExample : Pepe’s chicken house\n◦ Assume that the fixed costs of operating the chicken house, including the space and \nequipment, are 100.\n◦ The variable costs are the costs of hiring worker, which in our example is 50 per deliver. \n◦ Variable cost :  price of input  x  quantity of input.\n◦ When one unit of the input (worker) is added, the cost would be increased as much as the \nprice of the input (50 for the wage).\n\nExample : cost structure of the \nchicken house\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\n1 10\n2 18\n3 24\n4 28\n5 30\n6 31\n7 31.5\nThe law of diminishing marginal \nproduction\n\nExample : revenue of the chicken \nhouse\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nToral revenue Additional rev \n(from 1 more \nworker)\n1 10 300 300\n2 18 540 240\n3 24 720 180\n4 28 840 120\n5 30 900 60\n6 31 930 30\n7 31.5 945 15\nLet’s assume the \nprice of 1 chicken \n= 30!\nExample : cost structure of the \nchicken house\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nFixed cost Variable \ncost\nTotal cost Additional cost \n(1 worker)\n1 10 100 50 150 50\n2 18 100 100 200 50\n3 24 100 150 250 50\n4 28 100 200 300 50\n5 30 100 250 350 50\n6 31 100 300 400 50\n7 31.5 100 350 450 50\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nAdditional cost \n(1 worker)\nAdditional rev \n(1 worker)\n1 10 50 300\n2 18 50 240\n3 24 50 180\n4 28 50 120\n5 30 50 60\n6 31 50 30\n7 31.5 50 15\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nAdditional cost \n(1 worker)\nAdditional rev \n(1 worker)\n1 10 50 300\n2 18 50 240\n3 24 50 180\n4 28 50 120\n5 30 50 60\n6 31 50 30\n7 31.5 50 15\nMR = MC\nThe production function\n◦ We've discussed about the production cost, by using a \nproduction table.\n◦ Now, we can use the production function instead of the \nproduction table.\n◦ And then, from the production function, we can derive of each \ncost functions.\nThe production function\n◦ As the utility function, the form of the production function is \nusually assumed.\n◦ In our case, I assume a production function with the pattern of \ndiminishing marginal product.\n◦ Because this form is one of the basic form of production \nfunction which economists usually uses.\n• Functions and graphs\n• The concept of differentiation\n• Formulas for differentiation\nPreparations\n• Function : a special type of relation between X and Y .

Demand curve\nThe total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity \ndemanded. \nSo, In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. \nDemand is mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities \ndemanded at those prices.\n1. Demand curve\nP         Q\nP         Q \nEconomists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity \ndemanded the law of demand. \nThe law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand are \nheld constant.\n1. Demand curve\nQ\nP\n1. Demand curve\nDemand curves can somewhat different for each product. \nThey may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. \nNearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope \ndown from left to right. \n2. Supply curve\nQuantity supplied means the amount of some good or service a producer is \nwilling to supply at each price. \nPrice is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. \nA rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of \nthat good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied.\n2. Supply curve\nQ\nP\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n18000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nWhat will be happened in next?\nSome chicken houses can not sell their chickens. So, Raw chickens, oils, flours \nat their storages starts to go bad.\nSome chicken houses will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a \nlower price than not to sell at all. \nSo, if the price is above the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to fall toward the equilibrium.\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n12000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nConsumers always are waiting their order and chicken houses says that they \nare filled with orders and there are no more stock of raw meats.\nIt’s not difficult for chicken houses to realize that even if they raise the price, \nthey can sell their stock out.\nSo, if the price is below the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to rise toward the equilibrium.\n4. Equilibrium\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nQ* = 1000\nP*\n=15000\nE\nE’\n4. Equilibrium\nThe word “equilibrium” means “balance.” \nIf a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason to \nmove away from that point. \nHowever, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise to \nmove the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.\n4. Equilibrium\nIn 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether \nsupply or demand determined a price was like arguing\n“whether it is the upper or the \nunder blade of a pair of \nscissors that cuts a piece of \npaper.” \n\n5. Shift of demand curve\nPrice, however, is not the only thing that influences demand and supply.\nWhat if overall consumer’s income has changed? \nSometime preferences can be suddenly changed.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \n5. Shift of demand curve\nQ\nP\nD0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nD1\nD2\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDoes the higher income always bring greater demand?\nA product whose demand rises when income rises is called a normal good.\nbut, there is a few exceptions to this pattern do exist. \nA product whose demand falls when income rises is called an inferior good. \n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnd, for some goods such as luxury cars, fine cuisines, or jewelry, the effect of \na rise in income can be especially pronounced.\nWe called those luxury goods.\nA luxury good is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally \nas income rises, \n5. Shift of demand curve\nOf course, income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand.\nWe can think about some of other factors that shift demand curves.\nOne of those is changing tastes or preferences.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \nIt might cause a severe avoiding to eat chickens.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDemographic changes can also be a important factor.\nActually, the demographic changes is combined with the changes in preference.\nSince the consumption preference of youth and old person is quite different, \nchanges in the demographic structure directly affects the overall preference of \nthe society.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnother example is the housing demand.\nSince the demand for owning houses is usually peaked in the middle age about \n40s, the overall housing demand can also be peaked, when the number of \nmiddle-aged in the country is the highest level.\nSome economists have tried to predict the future housing prices by using \npredictable demographic changes.\nMankiw, N. G., & Weil, D. N. (1989). The baby boom, the baby bust, and the \nhousing market. Regional science and urban economics, 19(2), 235-258.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nIt is also true that expectations about the future price (or expectations about \ntastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand.\nFor example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the \nstore to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. \nThese changes can push the demand curve to the right.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nOne interest thing is that some goods can be seriously affected by the \nexpectation.\nFor example, we can think about housing market.\nDemand for housing is not only determined  by preferences, but also by the \nexpectations for capital gain.\nThis feature of housing markets sometimes causes speculations in housing \nmarkets.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nHow about the supply curves? \nOne of most important factor affecting the supply curve might be the \nproduction cost.\nIf a firm faces lower costs of production, a firm’s profits go up. This can be \nshown by the supply curve shifting to the right.\nif a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any \ngiven selling price for its products. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the \nleft.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nQ\nP\nS0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nS1 S2\n6. Shift of supply curve\nSeveral other things affect the cost of production, too. \nWe can think about new technologies for production, and some government \npolicies.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nWhen producers develops or discovers a technology that allows the firm to \nproduce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right, as well. \nThink about the cost of raising a chicken in chicken farm and the poultry \nfactory system.\n\n6. Shift of supply curve\nGovernment policies also can affect the cost of production and the supply \ncurve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies.\nA subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces the \nfirm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. \nFrom the firm’s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of \nproduction that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower \nquantity at every given price. \nSo, government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at \nevery given price, shifting supply to the right.\n7. Price controls\nIn some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on politicians\n\n7. Price controls\nLaws that government enacts to regulate prices are called Price controls.\nPrice controls come in two ways.\nA price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level.\nAnd, a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n18000\n15000 E0\nE1\n1200\n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE2\n1500\n7. Price controls\nA price floor is the lowest legal price that can be paid in the market.\nPrice floors are sometimes called price supports. \nBecause they support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE’\n1500\nE\n7. Price controls\nThe demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the \nincentives provided by these laws to control prices.\nAs a result, It will often lead to undesirable consequences. \nIt implies alternative policy tools can often achieve the desired goals of price \ncontrol laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs."

Maximization of the objective under the constraint (rationality)\n2. Maximization of the utility subject to the budget constraint\n•  Marginal analysis\n3.  Derivation of a demand curve\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Suppose there is a consumer whose name is Pepe. He is the representative agent of all customers in our \nsociety.\n\n1. Budget Constraint\n• We want to capture that consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and \nwant.\n• Pepe has 5,600 wons in spending money each week.\n• He can allocate this spending between meal ticket and shirts. \n• The meal tickets cost 700 wons each, and the shirts are 1,400 wons each.\n\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Of course, the budget constraint diagram containing just two goods is not realistic. \n• Because, in a modern economy, people choose from thousands of goods.\n• However, thinking about a model with many goods can be just a straightforward extension of what we \ndiscussed here.\n• The point is that there is always a trade-off problem in decisions.\n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket\n8\n4\n• Each point on the line of \nbudget constraint \nrepresents a combination \nof meal tickets and shirts, \nwhich the total cost adds \nup to Pepe’s budget of \n5,600 won. \nClothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• If he spend out his budget, we can \nthink his budget constraint is actually \nthe outer line of the colored area.\n• If he had unlimited income or goods \nwere free, then he could consume \nwithout limit.  \n• Any point outside the constraint is \nnot affordable, because it would cost \nmore money than Pepe has in his \nbudget.\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• It just means that,\n𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒.\n• In this case,\n• Income = 5,600 wons\n• Expenditure = 700 M + 1,400 S\n• So, 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• To draw it in a 2-D plane,\n➢5600 = 700M + 1400S\n➢700M = 5600 – 1400S\n➢M = 8 – 2S\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• The slope of the budget constraint is \ndetermined by the relative price. \n• Relative price - How many meal \ntickets would Pepe have to give up to \nget one more shirt, while staying \nwithin his budget?\n• All along the budget set, getting 1 \nshirt means giving up 2 meal tickets.\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Economists call it opportunity cost.\n• Opportunity cost indicate what have to be given up to obtain something. In other words, opportunity cost \nis the value of the next best alternative.\n• For Pepe, the opportunity cost of 1 shirt is the 2 meal tickets. \n• He would decide to buy one more shirt, If the value of the extra shirt exceed the value of the alternative \n(2 meal tickets).\n1. Budget Constraint\n• A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost.\n• If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost might be the time which would be spent \nto make up the class.\n• If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. \n• In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price.\n• For example, attending graduate school is the case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. \nThe explicit costs of attending college might be about tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. \nBut in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a \npaying job. Thus, graduate school imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost \nearnings.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if the price of a good changes?\n• Suppose that, the price of bus ticket increased to 1,400 won.\n• A price increase for bus tickets would have no effect on the ability to purchase Ramen. \n• But it would reduce the number of bus tickets which Pepe could afford to buy.\n• What happens in the budget constraint? Redraw it. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if Pepe’s income changes?\n• Suppose that, his income drops as a half(=2,800 won).\n• In this case, it would reduce the number of both of meal tickets and shirts which Pepe could afford to buy. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n4\n2\n1. Budget Constraint\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n2. Utility\n• People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility from using those goods and services.\n• Utility is the term which economists use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction/usefulness or \nhappiness with his or her choices.\n• Of course, in our daily life, we don’t measure such a thing. But, in model, it can be a quite useful \ninstrument to replicate the underlying incentive structure of each individuals.\n2. Utility\nEconomists assume the feature of utility\n1.The more of some good one consumes, the more utility \none obtains.\n2. As a person consumes more of a good, the additional (or \nmarginal) utility from each additional unit of the good \ndeclines.\n2. Utility\n• It is a general pattern that consumption of the first few units of good tends to bring a higher level of \nutility than consumption of later units.\n• Suppose that you are in thirsty. You can compare the degree to which the first few drops of water relieve \nthe thirst and the extent to which the drinking water later resolves the thirst.\n• Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility.\n• It means that, the utility of a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more \nthan the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.\n2. Utility\n• The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing \nchoices. \n• Most of people would not say, “My favorite food is potato, so I will eat nothing but only potatoes from \nnow on.”\n• Even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the marginal \nutility from those last few servings would not be very high. \n2. Utility\n• An example for the marginal utilities for meal ticket (and shirt):\n𝑀𝑈𝑀 = 1\n𝑀\n𝑀𝑈𝑆 = 1\n𝑆\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n• The marginal approach is based on looking at the tradeoffs(measured in terms of marginal utility per \nspending) of consuming less of one good and more of another.\n• Marginal utility of X = additional utility from consuming 1 more unit (the smallest unit we can imagine) \nof X\n• Which decision is better? Check the marginal utilities.\n• But we have to consider that the prices are different.\n• Relative price indicates how much unit of Y can be exchanged with 1 more X.\n• Marginal utility per spending of X = marginal utility of X / price of X\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 1\n• Which decision is better? Comparing the marginal utilities per spending.\n• Suppose an initial state of X,Y . What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n>\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ? Can he/she better off (by changing in decision for \nX,Y)? Yes. Suppose that he/she get more X by giving up some Y . \n• What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n<\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ?\n• After all adjustments, we derive the rule of maximization \n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\n• Note that there is no incentive to deviate from the equality condition.\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 2\n• Suppose that he/she starts to spend money from 0.\n• To make the best decision, he/she would choose the plan with a higher marginal utility per spending. For \nexample, if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n>\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n, he/she will choose X.\n• Note that the marginal utility of one good decreases as he/she consume more. If he/she consume X more \nand more, \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n<\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n. In that case, he/she can get more utility by getting more Y and giving up some X.\n• That means, if he/she is rational, he/she will stick to the condition,\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\nMarginal analysis\n: The rule of maximization\n• If there are other goods (which means, in more general terms),\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n= ⋯ =\n𝑴𝑼𝒁\n𝑷𝒁\n.\n• The rule of maximization captures several important characteristics of consumers in market economy.\n• The relationship among consumptions on different items.\n• The effect of price change\n• The effect of income change\n• How the shape of marginal utilities affect consumption plan (and how the consumption plan responses to income/price change)?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Budget constraint : 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nUtility function : 𝑀𝑈𝑀 =\n1\n𝑀, 𝑀𝑈𝑆 =\n1\n𝑆\n• What is the optimal choice for M, S?\n\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Now, let’s suppose that the income goes up to 11,200 won.\n\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nIncome effect\n• Income effect and the characteristics of good\n• Normal goods : an increase in income causes an increase in demand (+)\n• Inferior goods : an increase in income causes a decrease in demand (-)\n• Luxury goods : an increase in income causes a bigger percentage increase in demand (++)\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• What if the price of M goes to 1400 won ?\n\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• If the price of S falls to 700 won ?\n\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 8 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n8\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• When a price changes,\n• Substitution effect : change in relative price (the slope in budget constraint)\n• Income effect (of a price change) : shift in real purchasing power\n\nPrice effect\n• Price effect : an increase in price causes an decrease in demand (-)\n* Special case : Giffen goods – price effect (+)\n• Relationship between goods\n• Substitute goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\n• Complementary goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• Then, consider price effect on other good\n• On substitute goods : an increase in the price of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• On complementary goods : an increase in the price of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\nDemand curve\n• What is demand curve? The relationship between price and quantity demanded\n• What is the quantity demanded?

Law of diminishing marginal production\n◦ Marginal product of any input : the additional quantity of output obtained \nfrom one additional unit of that input.\nExample : Pepe’s chicken house\n◦ Assume that the fixed costs of operating the chicken house, including the space and \nequipment, are 100.\n◦ The variable costs are the costs of hiring worker, which in our example is 50 per deliver. \n◦ Variable cost :  price of input  x  quantity of input.\n◦ When one unit of the input (worker) is added, the cost would be increased as much as the \nprice of the input (50 for the wage).\n\nExample : cost structure of the \nchicken house\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\n1 10\n2 18\n3 24\n4 28\n5 30\n6 31\n7 31.5\nThe law of diminishing marginal \nproduction\n\nExample : revenue of the chicken \nhouse\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nToral revenue Additional rev \n(from 1 more \nworker)\n1 10 300 300\n2 18 540 240\n3 24 720 180\n4 28 840 120\n5 30 900 60\n6 31 930 30\n7 31.5 945 15\nLet’s assume the \nprice of 1 chicken \n= 30!\nExample : cost structure of the \nchicken house\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nFixed cost Variable \ncost\nTotal cost Additional cost \n(1 worker)\n1 10 100 50 150 50\n2 18 100 100 200 50\n3 24 100 150 250 50\n4 28 100 200 300 50\n5 30 100 250 350 50\n6 31 100 300 400 50\n7 31.5 100 350 450 50\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nAdditional cost \n(1 worker)\nAdditional rev \n(1 worker)\n1 10 50 300\n2 18 50 240\n3 24 50 180\n4 28 50 120\n5 30 50 60\n6 31 50 30\n7 31.5 50 15\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nAdditional cost \n(1 worker)\nAdditional rev \n(1 worker)\n1 10 50 300\n2 18 50 240\n3 24 50 180\n4 28 50 120\n5 30 50 60\n6 31 50 30\n7 31.5 50 15\nMR = MC\nThe production function\n◦ We've discussed about the production cost, by using a \nproduction table.\n◦ Now, we can use the production function instead of the \nproduction table.\n◦ And then, from the production function, we can derive of each \ncost functions.\nThe production function\n◦ As the utility function, the form of the production function is \nusually assumed.\n◦ In our case, I assume a production function with the pattern of \ndiminishing marginal product.\n◦ Because this form is one of the basic form of production \nfunction which economists usually uses.\n• Functions and graphs\n• The concept of differentiation\n• Formulas for differentiation\nPreparations\n• Function : a special type of relation between X and Y .

Introduction\nIn this week, we will learn about:\n- Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for \nGoods and Services\n-   Shifts in Demand and Supply curves\n- Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity\n- Price Ceilings and Price Floors\nMarket Equilibrium\nFirm\n1\nFirm\n2\nFirm\n3\nFirm\n4\nFirm\n5\nGood & \nservice \nmarket\nProduction \nfactor \nmarket\n\n1. Demand curve\nDemand the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able \nto purchase at each price. \nDemand for each good and services can be obtained by individual consumer’s \npreference and their budgets.\nDemand represent the amount of wiliness to pay of the society. \n1. Demand curve\nThe total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity \ndemanded. \nSo, In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. \nDemand is mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities \ndemanded at those prices.\n1. Demand curve\nP         Q\nP         Q \nEconomists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity \ndemanded the law of demand. \nThe law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand are \nheld constant.\n1. Demand curve\nQ\nP\n1. Demand curve\nDemand curves can somewhat different for each product. \nThey may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. \nNearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope \ndown from left to right. \n2. Supply curve\nQuantity supplied means the amount of some good or service a producer is \nwilling to supply at each price. \nPrice is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. \nA rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of \nthat good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied.\n2. Supply curve\nQ\nP\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n18000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nWhat will be happened in next?\nSome chicken houses can not sell their chickens. So, Raw chickens, oils, flours \nat their storages starts to go bad.\nSome chicken houses will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a \nlower price than not to sell at all. \nSo, if the price is above the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to fall toward the equilibrium.\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n12000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nConsumers always are waiting their order and chicken houses says that they \nare filled with orders and there are no more stock of raw meats.\nIt’s not difficult for chicken houses to realize that even if they raise the price, \nthey can sell their stock out.\nSo, if the price is below the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to rise toward the equilibrium.\n4. Equilibrium\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nQ* = 1000\nP*\n=15000\nE\nE’\n4. Equilibrium\nThe word “equilibrium” means “balance.” \nIf a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason to \nmove away from that point. \nHowever, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise to \nmove the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.\n4. Equilibrium\nIn 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether \nsupply or demand determined a price was like arguing\n“whether it is the upper or the \nunder blade of a pair of \nscissors that cuts a piece of \npaper.” \n\n5. Shift of demand curve\nPrice, however, is not the only thing that influences demand and supply.\nWhat if overall consumer’s income has changed? \nSometime preferences can be suddenly changed.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \n5. Shift of demand curve\nQ\nP\nD0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nD1\nD2\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDoes the higher income always bring greater demand?\nA product whose demand rises when income rises is called a normal good.\nbut, there is a few exceptions to this pattern do exist. \nA product whose demand falls when income rises is called an inferior good. \n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnd, for some goods such as luxury cars, fine cuisines, or jewelry, the effect of \na rise in income can be especially pronounced.\nWe called those luxury goods.\nA luxury good is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally \nas income rises, \n5. Shift of demand curve\nOf course, income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand.\nWe can think about some of other factors that shift demand curves.\nOne of those is changing tastes or preferences.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \nIt might cause a severe avoiding to eat chickens.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDemographic changes can also be a important factor.\nActually, the demographic changes is combined with the changes in preference.\nSince the consumption preference of youth and old person is quite different, \nchanges in the demographic structure directly affects the overall preference of \nthe society.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnother example is the housing demand.\nSince the demand for owning houses is usually peaked in the middle age about \n40s, the overall housing demand can also be peaked, when the number of \nmiddle-aged in the country is the highest level.\nSome economists have tried to predict the future housing prices by using \npredictable demographic changes.\nMankiw, N. G., & Weil, D. N. (1989). The baby boom, the baby bust, and the \nhousing market. Regional science and urban economics, 19(2), 235-258.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nIt is also true that expectations about the future price (or expectations about \ntastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand.\nFor example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the \nstore to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. \nThese changes can push the demand curve to the right.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nOne interest thing is that some goods can be seriously affected by the \nexpectation.\nFor example, we can think about housing market.\nDemand for housing is not only determined  by preferences, but also by the \nexpectations for capital gain.\nThis feature of housing markets sometimes causes speculations in housing \nmarkets.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nHow about the supply curves? \nOne of most important factor affecting the supply curve might be the \nproduction cost.\nIf a firm faces lower costs of production, a firm’s profits go up. This can be \nshown by the supply curve shifting to the right.\nif a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any \ngiven selling price for its products. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the \nleft.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nQ\nP\nS0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nS1 S2\n6. Shift of supply curve\nSeveral other things affect the cost of production, too. \nWe can think about new technologies for production, and some government \npolicies.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nWhen producers develops or discovers a technology that allows the firm to \nproduce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right, as well. \nThink about the cost of raising a chicken in chicken farm and the poultry \nfactory system.\n\n6. Shift of supply curve\nGovernment policies also can affect the cost of production and the supply \ncurve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies.\nA subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces the \nfirm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. \nFrom the firm’s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of \nproduction that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower \nquantity at every given price. \nSo, government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at \nevery given price, shifting supply to the right.\n7. Price controls\nIn some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on politicians\n\n7. Price controls\nLaws that government enacts to regulate prices are called Price controls.\nPrice controls come in two ways.\nA price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level.\nAnd, a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n18000\n15000 E0\nE1\n1200\n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE2\n1500\n7. Price controls\nA price floor is the lowest legal price that can be paid in the market.\nPrice floors are sometimes called price supports. \nBecause they support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE’\n1500\nE\n7. Price controls\nThe demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the \nincentives provided by these laws to control prices.\nAs a result, It will often lead to undesirable consequences. \nIt implies alternative policy tools can often achieve the desired goals of price \ncontrol laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs."

Budget Constraint\n• Suppose there is a consumer whose name is Pepe. He is the representative agent of all customers in our \nsociety.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• We want to capture that consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and \nwant.\n• Pepe has 5,600 wons in spending money each week.\n• He can allocate this spending between meal ticket and shirts. \n• The meal tickets cost 700 wons each, and the shirts are 1,400 wons each.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Of course, the budget constraint diagram containing just two goods is not realistic. \n• Because, in a modern economy, people choose from thousands of goods.\n• However, thinking about a model with many goods can be just a straightforward extension of what we \ndiscussed here.\n• The point is that there is always a trade-off problem in decisions.\n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket\n8\n4\n• Each point on the line of \nbudget constraint \nrepresents a combination \nof meal tickets and shirts, \nwhich the total cost adds \nup to Pepe’s budget of \n5,600 won. \nClothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• If he spend out his budget, we can \nthink his budget constraint is actually \nthe outer line of the colored area.\n• If he had unlimited income or goods \nwere free, then he could consume \nwithout limit.  \n• Any point outside the constraint is \nnot affordable, because it would cost \nmore money than Pepe has in his \nbudget.\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• It just means that,\n𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒.\n• In this case,\n• Income = 5,600 wons\n• Expenditure = 700 M + 1,400 S\n• So, 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• To draw it in a 2-D plane,\n➢5600 = 700M + 1400S\n➢700M = 5600 – 1400S\n➢M = 8 – 2S\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• The slope of the budget constraint is \ndetermined by the relative price. \n• Relative price - How many meal \ntickets would Pepe have to give up to \nget one more shirt, while staying \nwithin his budget?\n• All along the budget set, getting 1 \nshirt means giving up 2 meal tickets.\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Economists call it opportunity cost.\n• Opportunity cost indicate what have to be given up to obtain something. In other words, opportunity cost \nis the value of the next best alternative.\n• For Pepe, the opportunity cost of 1 shirt is the 2 meal tickets. \n• He would decide to buy one more shirt, If the value of the extra shirt exceed the value of the alternative \n(2 meal tickets).\n1. Budget Constraint\n• A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost.\n• If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost might be the time which would be spent \nto make up the class.\n• If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. \n• In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price.\n• For example, attending graduate school is the case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. \nThe explicit costs of attending college might be about tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. \nBut in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a \npaying job. Thus, graduate school imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost \nearnings.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if the price of a good changes?\n• Suppose that, the price of bus ticket increased to 1,400 won.\n• A price increase for bus tickets would have no effect on the ability to purchase Ramen. \n• But it would reduce the number of bus tickets which Pepe could afford to buy.\n• What happens in the budget constraint? Redraw it. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if Pepe’s income changes?\n• Suppose that, his income drops as a half(=2,800 won).\n• In this case, it would reduce the number of both of meal tickets and shirts which Pepe could afford to buy. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n4\n2\n1. Budget Constraint\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n2. Utility\n• People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility from using those goods and services.\n• Utility is the term which economists use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction/usefulness or \nhappiness with his or her choices.\n• Of course, in our daily life, we don’t measure such a thing. But, in model, it can be a quite useful \ninstrument to replicate the underlying incentive structure of each individuals.\n2. Utility\nEconomists assume the feature of utility\n1.The more of some good one consumes, the more utility \none obtains.\n2. As a person consumes more of a good, the additional (or \nmarginal) utility from each additional unit of the good \ndeclines.\n2. Utility\n• It is a general pattern that consumption of the first few units of good tends to bring a higher level of \nutility than consumption of later units.\n• Suppose that you are in thirsty. You can compare the degree to which the first few drops of water relieve \nthe thirst and the extent to which the drinking water later resolves the thirst.\n• Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility.\n• It means that, the utility of a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more \nthan the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.\n2. Utility\n• The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing \nchoices. \n• Most of people would not say, “My favorite food is potato, so I will eat nothing but only potatoes from \nnow on.”\n• Even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the marginal \nutility from those last few servings would not be very high. \n2. Utility\n• An example for the marginal utilities for meal ticket (and shirt):\n𝑀𝑈𝑀 = 1\n𝑀\n𝑀𝑈𝑆 = 1\n𝑆\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n• The marginal approach is based on looking at the tradeoffs(measured in terms of marginal utility per \nspending) of consuming less of one good and more of another.\n• Marginal utility of X = additional utility from consuming 1 more unit (the smallest unit we can imagine) \nof X\n• Which decision is better? Check the marginal utilities.\n• But we have to consider that the prices are different.\n• Relative price indicates how much unit of Y can be exchanged with 1 more X.\n• Marginal utility per spending of X = marginal utility of X / price of X\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 1\n• Which decision is better? Comparing the marginal utilities per spending.\n• Suppose an initial state of X,Y . What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ? Can he/she better off (by changing in decision for \nX,Y)? Yes. Suppose that he/she get more X by giving up some Y .\n• What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ?\n• After all adjustments, we derive the rule of maximization \n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\n• Note that there is no incentive to deviate from the equality condition.\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 2\n• Suppose that he/she starts to spend money from 0.\n• To make the best decision, he/she would choose the plan with a higher marginal utility per spending. For \nexample, if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n, he/she will choose X.\n• Note that the marginal utility of one good decreases as he/she consume more. If he/she consume X more \nand more, \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n. In that case, he/she can get more utility by getting more Y and giving up some X.\n• That means, if he/she is rational, he/she will stick to the condition,\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\nMarginal analysis\n: The rule of maximization\n• If there are other goods (which means, in more general terms),\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n= ⋯ =\n𝑴𝑼𝒁\n𝑷𝒁\n.\n• The rule of maximization captures several important characteristics of consumers in market economy.\n• The relationship among consumptions on different items.\n• The effect of price change\n• The effect of income change\n• How the shape of marginal utilities affect consumption plan (and how the consumption plan responses to income/price change)?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Budget constraint : 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nUtility function : 𝑀𝑈𝑀 = \n1\n𝑀, 𝑀𝑈𝑆 = \n1\n𝑆\n• What is the optimal choice for M, S?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Now, let’s suppose that the income goes up to 11,200 won.\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nIncome effect\n• Income effect and the characteristics of good\n• Normal goods : an increase in income causes an increase in demand (+)\n• Inferior goods : an increase in income causes a decrease in demand (-)\n• Luxury goods : an increase in income causes a bigger percentage increase in demand (++)\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• What if the price of M goes to 1400 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• If the price of S falls to 700 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 8 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n8\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• When a price changes,\n• Substitution effect : change in relative price (the slope in budget constraint)\n• Income effect (of a price change) : shift in real purchasing power\nPrice effect\n• Price effect : an increase in price causes an decrease in demand (-)\n* Special case : Giffen goods – price effect (+)\n• Relationship between goods\n• Substitute goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\n• Complementary goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• Then, consider price effect on other good\n• On substitute goods : an increase in the price of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• On complementary goods : an increase in the price of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\nDemand curve\n• What is demand curve?

In the short run, we can classify the \ncosts into fixed costs and variable costs.\n◦ Fixed costs are the costs that cannot be changed in the short run.\n◦ Variable costs are the costs that can be changed.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of \nproduction, at least not in the short term.\n◦ For example, the cost of building factory or buying heavy equipment, research and \ndevelopment costs, advertising expenses. \n◦ The level of fixed costs varies according to the feature of the products or \nindustry. \n◦ For instance, manufacturing mobile phone or computer chips requires an \nexpensive factory. But, a food-truck or a painting artist can get by with \nrelatively less fixed costs.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Variable costs are incurred in the act of producing.\n◦ For example, wages and cost to buy intermediate goods are variable costs.\n◦ The more you produce, the greater the variable cost.\n◦ Total cost = fixed cost + variable cost.\nThe nature of production\n◦ Two assumptions:\n1.

Introduction\nIn this week, we will learn about:\n- Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for \nGoods and Services\n-   Shifts in Demand and Supply curves\n- Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity\n- Price Ceilings and Price Floors\nMarket Equilibrium\nFirm\n1\nFirm\n2\nFirm\n3\nFirm\n4\nFirm\n5\nGood & \nservice \nmarket\nProduction \nfactor \nmarket\n1. Demand curve\nDemand the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able \nto purchase at each price. \nDemand for each good and services can be obtained by individual consumer’s \npreference and their budgets.\nDemand represent the amount of wiliness to pay of the society. \n1. Demand curve\nThe total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity \ndemanded. \nSo, In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. \nDemand is mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities \ndemanded at those prices.\n1. Demand curve\nP         Q\nP         Q \nEconomists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity \ndemanded the law of demand. \nThe law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand are \nheld constant.\n1. Demand curve\nQ\nP\n1. Demand curve\nDemand curves can somewhat different for each product. \nThey may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. \nNearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope \ndown from left to right. \n2. Supply curve\nQuantity supplied means the amount of some good or service a producer is \nwilling to supply at each price. \nPrice is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. \nA rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of \nthat good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied.\n2. Supply curve\nQ\nP\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n18000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nWhat will be happened in next?\nSome chicken houses can not sell their chickens. So, Raw chickens, oils, flours \nat their storages starts to go bad.\nSome chicken houses will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a \nlower price than not to sell at all. \nSo, if the price is above the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to fall toward the equilibrium.\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n12000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nConsumers always are waiting their order and chicken houses says that they \nare filled with orders and there are no more stock of raw meats.\nIt’s not difficult for chicken houses to realize that even if they raise the price, \nthey can sell their stock out.\nSo, if the price is below the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to rise toward the equilibrium.\n4. Equilibrium\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nQ* = 1000\nP*\n=15000\nE\nE’\n4. Equilibrium\nThe word “equilibrium” means “balance.” \nIf a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason to \nmove away from that point. \nHowever, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise to \nmove the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.\n4. Equilibrium\nIn 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether \nsupply or demand determined a price was like arguing\n“whether it is the upper or the \nunder blade of a pair of \nscissors that cuts a piece of \npaper.” \n5. Shift of demand curve\nPrice, however, is not the only thing that influences demand and supply.\nWhat if overall consumer’s income has changed? \nSometime preferences can be suddenly changed.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \n5. Shift of demand curve\nQ\nP\nD0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nD1\nD2\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDoes the higher income always bring greater demand?\nA product whose demand rises when income rises is called a normal good.\nbut, there is a few exceptions to this pattern do exist. \nA product whose demand falls when income rises is called an inferior good. \n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnd, for some goods such as luxury cars, fine cuisines, or jewelry, the effect of \na rise in income can be especially pronounced.\nWe called those luxury goods.\nA luxury good is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally \nas income rises, \n5. Shift of demand curve\nOf course, income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand.\nWe can think about some of other factors that shift demand curves.\nOne of those is changing tastes or preferences.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \nIt might cause a severe avoiding to eat chickens.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDemographic changes can also be a important factor.\nActually, the demographic changes is combined with the changes in preference.\nSince the consumption preference of youth and old person is quite different, \nchanges in the demographic structure directly affects the overall preference of \nthe society.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnother example is the housing demand.\nSince the demand for owning houses is usually peaked in the middle age about \n40s, the overall housing demand can also be peaked, when the number of \nmiddle-aged in the country is the highest level.\nSome economists have tried to predict the future housing prices by using \npredictable demographic changes.\nMankiw, N. G., & Weil, D. N. (1989). The baby boom, the baby bust, and the \nhousing market. Regional science and urban economics, 19(2), 235-258.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nIt is also true that expectations about the future price (or expectations about \ntastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand.\nFor example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the \nstore to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. \nThese changes can push the demand curve to the right.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nOne interest thing is that some goods can be seriously affected by the \nexpectation.\nFor example, we can think about housing market.\nDemand for housing is not only determined  by preferences, but also by the \nexpectations for capital gain.\nThis feature of housing markets sometimes causes speculations in housing \nmarkets.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nHow about the supply curves? \nOne of most important factor affecting the supply curve might be the \nproduction cost.\nIf a firm faces lower costs of production, a firm’s profits go up. This can be \nshown by the supply curve shifting to the right.\nif a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any \ngiven selling price for its products. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the \nleft.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nQ\nP\nS0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nS1 S2\n6. Shift of supply curve\nSeveral other things affect the cost of production, too. \nWe can think about new technologies for production, and some government \npolicies.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nWhen producers develops or discovers a technology that allows the firm to \nproduce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right, as well. \nThink about the cost of raising a chicken in chicken farm and the poultry \nfactory system.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nGovernment policies also can affect the cost of production and the supply \ncurve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies.\nA subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces the \nfirm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. \nFrom the firm’s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of \nproduction that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower \nquantity at every given price. \nSo, government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at \nevery given price, shifting supply to the right.\n7. Price controls\nIn some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on politicians\n7. Price controls\nLaws that government enacts to regulate prices are called Price controls.\nPrice controls come in two ways.\nA price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level.\nAnd, a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n18000\n15000 E0\nE1\n1200\n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE2\n1500\n7. Price controls\nA price floor is the lowest legal price that can be paid in the market.\nPrice floors are sometimes called price supports. \nBecause they support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE’\n1500\nE\n7. Price controls\nThe demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the \nincentives provided by these laws to control prices.\nAs a result, It will often lead to undesirable consequences. \nIt implies alternative policy tools can often achieve the desired goals of price \ncontrol laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs."

Maximization of the objective under the constraint (rationality)\n2. Maximization of the utility subject to the budget constraint\n•  Marginal analysis\n3.  Derivation of a demand curve\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Suppose there is a consumer whose name is Pepe. He is the representative agent of all customers in our \nsociety.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• We want to capture that consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and \nwant.\n• Pepe has 5,600 wons in spending money each week.\n• He can allocate this spending between meal ticket and shirts. \n• The meal tickets cost 700 wons each, and the shirts are 1,400 wons each.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Of course, the budget constraint diagram containing just two goods is not realistic. \n• Because, in a modern economy, people choose from thousands of goods.\n• However, thinking about a model with many goods can be just a straightforward extension of what we \ndiscussed here.\n• The point is that there is always a trade-off problem in decisions.\n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket\n8\n4\n• Each point on the line of \nbudget constraint \nrepresents a combination \nof meal tickets and shirts, \nwhich the total cost adds \nup to Pepe’s budget of \n5,600 won. \nClothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• If he spend out his budget, we can \nthink his budget constraint is actually \nthe outer line of the colored area.\n• If he had unlimited income or goods \nwere free, then he could consume \nwithout limit.  \n• Any point outside the constraint is \nnot affordable, because it would cost \nmore money than Pepe has in his \nbudget.\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• It just means that,\n𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒.\n• In this case,\n• Income = 5,600 wons\n• Expenditure = 700 M + 1,400 S\n• So, 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• To draw it in a 2-D plane,\n➢5600 = 700M + 1400S\n➢700M = 5600 – 1400S\n➢M = 8 – 2S\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• The slope of the budget constraint is \ndetermined by the relative price. \n• Relative price - How many meal \ntickets would Pepe have to give up to \nget one more shirt, while staying \nwithin his budget?\n• All along the budget set, getting 1 \nshirt means giving up 2 meal tickets.\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Economists call it opportunity cost.\n• Opportunity cost indicate what have to be given up to obtain something. In other words, opportunity cost \nis the value of the next best alternative.\n• For Pepe, the opportunity cost of 1 shirt is the 2 meal tickets. \n• He would decide to buy one more shirt, If the value of the extra shirt exceed the value of the alternative \n(2 meal tickets).\n1. Budget Constraint\n• A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost.\n• If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost might be the time which would be spent \nto make up the class.\n• If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. \n• In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price.\n• For example, attending graduate school is the case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. \nThe explicit costs of attending college might be about tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. \nBut in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a \npaying job. Thus, graduate school imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost \nearnings.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if the price of a good changes?\n• Suppose that, the price of bus ticket increased to 1,400 won.\n• A price increase for bus tickets would have no effect on the ability to purchase Ramen. \n• But it would reduce the number of bus tickets which Pepe could afford to buy.\n• What happens in the budget constraint? Redraw it. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if Pepe’s income changes?\n• Suppose that, his income drops as a half(=2,800 won).\n• In this case, it would reduce the number of both of meal tickets and shirts which Pepe could afford to buy. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n4\n2\n1. Budget Constraint\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n2. Utility\n• People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility from using those goods and services.\n• Utility is the term which economists use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction/usefulness or \nhappiness with his or her choices.\n• Of course, in our daily life, we don’t measure such a thing. But, in model, it can be a quite useful \ninstrument to replicate the underlying incentive structure of each individuals.\n2. Utility\nEconomists assume the feature of utility\n1.The more of some good one consumes, the more utility \none obtains.\n2. As a person consumes more of a good, the additional (or \nmarginal) utility from each additional unit of the good \ndeclines.\n2. Utility\n• It is a general pattern that consumption of the first few units of good tends to bring a higher level of \nutility than consumption of later units.\n• Suppose that you are in thirsty. You can compare the degree to which the first few drops of water relieve \nthe thirst and the extent to which the drinking water later resolves the thirst.\n• Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility.\n• It means that, the utility of a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more \nthan the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.\n2. Utility\n• The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing \nchoices. \n• Most of people would not say, “My favorite food is potato, so I will eat nothing but only potatoes from \nnow on.”\n• Even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the marginal \nutility from those last few servings would not be very high. \n2. Utility\n• An example for the marginal utilities for meal ticket (and shirt):\n𝑀𝑈𝑀 = 1\n𝑀\n𝑀𝑈𝑆 = 1\n𝑆\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n• The marginal approach is based on looking at the tradeoffs(measured in terms of marginal utility per \nspending) of consuming less of one good and more of another.\n• Marginal utility of X = additional utility from consuming 1 more unit (the smallest unit we can imagine) \nof X\n• Which decision is better? Check the marginal utilities.\n• But we have to consider that the prices are different.\n• Relative price indicates how much unit of Y can be exchanged with 1 more X.\n• Marginal utility per spending of X = marginal utility of X / price of X\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 1\n• Which decision is better? Comparing the marginal utilities per spending.\n• Suppose an initial state of X,Y . What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ? Can he/she better off (by changing in decision for \nX,Y)? Yes. Suppose that he/she get more X by giving up some Y .\n• What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ?\n• After all adjustments, we derive the rule of maximization \n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\n• Note that there is no incentive to deviate from the equality condition.\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 2\n• Suppose that he/she starts to spend money from 0.\n• To make the best decision, he/she would choose the plan with a higher marginal utility per spending. For \nexample, if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n, he/she will choose X.\n• Note that the marginal utility of one good decreases as he/she consume more. If he/she consume X more \nand more, \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n. In that case, he/she can get more utility by getting more Y and giving up some X.\n• That means, if he/she is rational, he/she will stick to the condition,\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\nMarginal analysis\n: The rule of maximization\n• If there are other goods (which means, in more general terms),\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n= ⋯ =\n𝑴𝑼𝒁\n𝑷𝒁\n.\n• The rule of maximization captures several important characteristics of consumers in market economy.\n• The relationship among consumptions on different items.\n• The effect of price change\n• The effect of income change\n• How the shape of marginal utilities affect consumption plan (and how the consumption plan responses to income/price change)?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Budget constraint : 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nUtility function : 𝑀𝑈𝑀 = \n1\n𝑀, 𝑀𝑈𝑆 = \n1\n𝑆\n• What is the optimal choice for M, S?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Now, let’s suppose that the income goes up to 11,200 won.\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nIncome effect\n• Income effect and the characteristics of good\n• Normal goods : an increase in income causes an increase in demand (+)\n• Inferior goods : an increase in income causes a decrease in demand (-)\n• Luxury goods : an increase in income causes a bigger percentage increase in demand (++)\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• What if the price of M goes to 1400 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• If the price of S falls to 700 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 8 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n8\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• When a price changes,\n• Substitution effect : change in relative price (the slope in budget constraint)\n• Income effect (of a price change) : shift in real purchasing power\nPrice effect\n• Price effect : an increase in price causes an decrease in demand (-)\n* Special case : Giffen goods – price effect (+)\n• Relationship between goods\n• Substitute goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\n• Complementary goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• Then, consider price effect on other good\n• On substitute goods : an increase in the price of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• On complementary goods : an increase in the price of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\nDemand curve\n• What is demand curve?

In the short run, we can classify the \ncosts into fixed costs and variable costs.\n◦ Fixed costs are the costs that cannot be changed in the short run.\n◦ Variable costs are the costs that can be changed.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of \nproduction, at least not in the short term.\n◦ For example, the cost of building factory or buying heavy equipment, research and \ndevelopment costs, advertising expenses. \n◦ The level of fixed costs varies according to the feature of the products or \nindustry. \n◦ For instance, manufacturing mobile phone or computer chips requires an \nexpensive factory. But, a food-truck or a painting artist can get by with \nrelatively less fixed costs.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Variable costs are incurred in the act of producing.\n◦ For example, wages and cost to buy intermediate goods are variable costs.\n◦ The more you produce, the greater the variable cost.\n◦ Total cost = fixed cost + variable cost.\nThe nature of production\n◦ Two assumptions:\n1.

Introduction\nIn this week, we will learn about:\n- Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for \nGoods and Services\n-   Shifts in Demand and Supply curves\n- Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity\n- Price Ceilings and Price Floors\nMarket Equilibrium\nFirm\n1\nFirm\n2\nFirm\n3\nFirm\n4\nFirm\n5\nGood & \nservice \nmarket\nProduction \nfactor \nmarket\n1. Demand curve\nDemand the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able \nto purchase at each price. \nDemand for each good and services can be obtained by individual consumer’s \npreference and their budgets.\nDemand represent the amount of wiliness to pay of the society. \n1. Demand curve\nThe total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity \ndemanded. \nSo, In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. \nDemand is mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities \ndemanded at those prices.\n1. Demand curve\nP         Q\nP         Q \nEconomists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity \ndemanded the law of demand. \nThe law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand are \nheld constant.\n1. Demand curve\nQ\nP\n1. Demand curve\nDemand curves can somewhat different for each product. \nThey may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. \nNearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope \ndown from left to right. \n2. Supply curve\nQuantity supplied means the amount of some good or service a producer is \nwilling to supply at each price. \nPrice is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. \nA rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of \nthat good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied.\n2. Supply curve\nQ\nP\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n18000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nWhat will be happened in next?\nSome chicken houses can not sell their chickens. So, Raw chickens, oils, flours \nat their storages starts to go bad.\nSome chicken houses will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a \nlower price than not to sell at all. \nSo, if the price is above the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to fall toward the equilibrium.\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n12000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nConsumers always are waiting their order and chicken houses says that they \nare filled with orders and there are no more stock of raw meats.\nIt’s not difficult for chicken houses to realize that even if they raise the price, \nthey can sell their stock out.\nSo, if the price is below the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to rise toward the equilibrium.\n4. Equilibrium\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nQ* = 1000\nP*\n=15000\nE\nE’\n4. Equilibrium\nThe word “equilibrium” means “balance.” \nIf a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason to \nmove away from that point. \nHowever, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise to \nmove the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.\n4. Equilibrium\nIn 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether \nsupply or demand determined a price was like arguing\n“whether it is the upper or the \nunder blade of a pair of \nscissors that cuts a piece of \npaper.” \n5. Shift of demand curve\nPrice, however, is not the only thing that influences demand and supply.\nWhat if overall consumer’s income has changed? \nSometime preferences can be suddenly changed.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \n5. Shift of demand curve\nQ\nP\nD0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nD1\nD2\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDoes the higher income always bring greater demand?\nA product whose demand rises when income rises is called a normal good.\nbut, there is a few exceptions to this pattern do exist. \nA product whose demand falls when income rises is called an inferior good. \n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnd, for some goods such as luxury cars, fine cuisines, or jewelry, the effect of \na rise in income can be especially pronounced.\nWe called those luxury goods.\nA luxury good is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally \nas income rises, \n5. Shift of demand curve\nOf course, income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand.\nWe can think about some of other factors that shift demand curves.\nOne of those is changing tastes or preferences.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \nIt might cause a severe avoiding to eat chickens.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDemographic changes can also be a important factor.\nActually, the demographic changes is combined with the changes in preference.\nSince the consumption preference of youth and old person is quite different, \nchanges in the demographic structure directly affects the overall preference of \nthe society.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnother example is the housing demand.\nSince the demand for owning houses is usually peaked in the middle age about \n40s, the overall housing demand can also be peaked, when the number of \nmiddle-aged in the country is the highest level.\nSome economists have tried to predict the future housing prices by using \npredictable demographic changes.\nMankiw, N. G., & Weil, D. N. (1989). The baby boom, the baby bust, and the \nhousing market. Regional science and urban economics, 19(2), 235-258.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nIt is also true that expectations about the future price (or expectations about \ntastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand.\nFor example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the \nstore to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. \nThese changes can push the demand curve to the right.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nOne interest thing is that some goods can be seriously affected by the \nexpectation.\nFor example, we can think about housing market.\nDemand for housing is not only determined  by preferences, but also by the \nexpectations for capital gain.\nThis feature of housing markets sometimes causes speculations in housing \nmarkets.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nHow about the supply curves? \nOne of most important factor affecting the supply curve might be the \nproduction cost.\nIf a firm faces lower costs of production, a firm’s profits go up. This can be \nshown by the supply curve shifting to the right.\nif a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any \ngiven selling price for its products. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the \nleft.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nQ\nP\nS0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nS1 S2\n6. Shift of supply curve\nSeveral other things affect the cost of production, too. \nWe can think about new technologies for production, and some government \npolicies.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nWhen producers develops or discovers a technology that allows the firm to \nproduce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right, as well. \nThink about the cost of raising a chicken in chicken farm and the poultry \nfactory system.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nGovernment policies also can affect the cost of production and the supply \ncurve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies.\nA subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces the \nfirm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. \nFrom the firm’s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of \nproduction that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower \nquantity at every given price. \nSo, government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at \nevery given price, shifting supply to the right.\n7. Price controls\nIn some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on politicians\n7. Price controls\nLaws that government enacts to regulate prices are called Price controls.\nPrice controls come in two ways.\nA price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level.\nAnd, a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n18000\n15000 E0\nE1\n1200\n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE2\n1500\n7. Price controls\nA price floor is the lowest legal price that can be paid in the market.\nPrice floors are sometimes called price supports. \nBecause they support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE’\n1500\nE\n7. Price controls\nThe demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the \nincentives provided by these laws to control prices.\nAs a result, It will often lead to undesirable consequences. \nIt implies alternative policy tools can often achieve the desired goals of price \ncontrol laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs."

Budget Constraint\n• Suppose there is a consumer whose name is Pepe. He is the representative agent of all customers in our \nsociety.\n\n1. Budget Constraint\n• We want to capture that consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and \nwant.\n• Pepe has 5,600 wons in spending money each week.\n• He can allocate this spending between meal ticket and shirts. \n• The meal tickets cost 700 wons each, and the shirts are 1,400 wons each.\n\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Of course, the budget constraint diagram containing just two goods is not realistic. \n• Because, in a modern economy, people choose from thousands of goods.\n• However, thinking about a model with many goods can be just a straightforward extension of what we \ndiscussed here.\n• The point is that there is always a trade-off problem in decisions.\n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket\n8\n4\n• Each point on the line of \nbudget constraint \nrepresents a combination \nof meal tickets and shirts, \nwhich the total cost adds \nup to Pepe’s budget of \n5,600 won. \nClothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• If he spend out his budget, we can \nthink his budget constraint is actually \nthe outer line of the colored area.\n• If he had unlimited income or goods \nwere free, then he could consume \nwithout limit.  \n• Any point outside the constraint is \nnot affordable, because it would cost \nmore money than Pepe has in his \nbudget.\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• It just means that,\n𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒.\n• In this case,\n• Income = 5,600 wons\n• Expenditure = 700 M + 1,400 S\n• So, 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• To draw it in a 2-D plane,\n➢5600 = 700M + 1400S\n➢700M = 5600 – 1400S\n➢M = 8 – 2S\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• The slope of the budget constraint is \ndetermined by the relative price. \n• Relative price - How many meal \ntickets would Pepe have to give up to \nget one more shirt, while staying \nwithin his budget?\n• All along the budget set, getting 1 \nshirt means giving up 2 meal tickets.\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Economists call it opportunity cost.\n• Opportunity cost indicate what have to be given up to obtain something. In other words, opportunity cost \nis the value of the next best alternative.\n• For Pepe, the opportunity cost of 1 shirt is the 2 meal tickets. \n• He would decide to buy one more shirt, If the value of the extra shirt exceed the value of the alternative \n(2 meal tickets).\n1. Budget Constraint\n• A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost.\n• If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost might be the time which would be spent \nto make up the class.\n• If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. \n• In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price.\n• For example, attending graduate school is the case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. \nThe explicit costs of attending college might be about tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. \nBut in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a \npaying job. Thus, graduate school imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost \nearnings.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if the price of a good changes?\n• Suppose that, the price of bus ticket increased to 1,400 won.\n• A price increase for bus tickets would have no effect on the ability to purchase Ramen. \n• But it would reduce the number of bus tickets which Pepe could afford to buy.\n• What happens in the budget constraint?

Utility\n• People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility from using those goods and services.\n• Utility is the term which economists use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction/usefulness or \nhappiness with his or her choices.\n• Of course, in our daily life, we don’t measure such a thing. But, in model, it can be a quite useful \ninstrument to replicate the underlying incentive structure of each individuals.\n2. Utility\nEconomists assume the feature of utility\n1.The more of some good one consumes, the more utility \none obtains.\n2. As a person consumes more of a good, the additional (or \nmarginal) utility from each additional unit of the good \ndeclines.\n2. Utility\n• It is a general pattern that consumption of the first few units of good tends to bring a higher level of \nutility than consumption of later units.\n• Suppose that you are in thirsty. You can compare the degree to which the first few drops of water relieve \nthe thirst and the extent to which the drinking water later resolves the thirst.\n• Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility.\n• It means that, the utility of a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more \nthan the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.\n2. Utility\n• The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing \nchoices. \n• Most of people would not say, “My favorite food is potato, so I will eat nothing but only potatoes from \nnow on.”\n• Even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the marginal \nutility from those last few servings would not be very high. \n2. Utility\n• An example for the marginal utilities for meal ticket (and shirt):\n𝑀𝑈𝑀 = 1\n𝑀\n𝑀𝑈𝑆 = 1\n𝑆\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n• The marginal approach is based on looking at the tradeoffs(measured in terms of marginal utility per \nspending) of consuming less of one good and more of another.\n• Marginal utility of X = additional utility from consuming 1 more unit (the smallest unit we can imagine) \nof X\n• Which decision is better? Check the marginal utilities.\n• But we have to consider that the prices are different.\n• Relative price indicates how much unit of Y can be exchanged with 1 more X.\n• Marginal utility per spending of X = marginal utility of X / price of X\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 1\n• Which decision is better? Comparing the marginal utilities per spending.\n• Suppose an initial state of X,Y . What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n>\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ? Can he/she better off (by changing in decision for \nX,Y)? Yes. Suppose that he/she get more X by giving up some Y . \n• What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n<\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ?\n• After all adjustments, we derive the rule of maximization \n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\n• Note that there is no incentive to deviate from the equality condition.\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 2\n• Suppose that he/she starts to spend money from 0.\n• To make the best decision, he/she would choose the plan with a higher marginal utility per spending. For \nexample, if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n>\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n, he/she will choose X.\n• Note that the marginal utility of one good decreases as he/she consume more. If he/she consume X more \nand more, \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n<\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n. In that case, he/she can get more utility by getting more Y and giving up some X.\n• That means, if he/she is rational, he/she will stick to the condition,\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\nMarginal analysis\n: The rule of maximization\n• If there are other goods (which means, in more general terms),\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n= ⋯ =\n𝑴𝑼𝒁\n𝑷𝒁\n.\n• The rule of maximization captures several important characteristics of consumers in market economy.\n• The relationship among consumptions on different items.\n• The effect of price change\n• The effect of income change\n• How the shape of marginal utilities affect consumption plan (and how the consumption plan responses to income/price change)?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Budget constraint : 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nUtility function : 𝑀𝑈𝑀 =\n1\n𝑀, 𝑀𝑈𝑆 =\n1\n𝑆\n• What is the optimal choice for M, S?\n\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Now, let’s suppose that the income goes up to 11,200 won.\n\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nIncome effect\n• Income effect and the characteristics of good\n• Normal goods : an increase in income causes an increase in demand (+)\n• Inferior goods : an increase in income causes a decrease in demand (-)\n• Luxury goods : an increase in income causes a bigger percentage increase in demand (++)\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• What if the price of M goes to 1400 won ?\n\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• If the price of S falls to 700 won ?\n\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 8 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n8\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• When a price changes,\n• Substitution effect : change in relative price (the slope in budget constraint)\n• Income effect (of a price change) : shift in real purchasing power\n\nPrice effect\n• Price effect : an increase in price causes an decrease in demand (-)\n* Special case : Giffen goods – price effect (+)\n• Relationship between goods\n• Substitute goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\n• Complementary goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• Then, consider price effect on other good\n• On substitute goods : an increase in the price of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• On complementary goods : an increase in the price of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\nDemand curve\n• What is demand curve?

In the short run, we can classify the \ncosts into fixed costs and variable costs.\n◦ Fixed costs are the costs that cannot be changed in the short run.\n◦ Variable costs are the costs that can be changed.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of \nproduction, at least not in the short term.\n◦ For example, the cost of building factory or buying heavy equipment, research and \ndevelopment costs, advertising expenses. \n◦ The level of fixed costs varies according to the feature of the products or \nindustry. \n◦ For instance, manufacturing mobile phone or computer chips requires an \nexpensive factory. But, a food-truck or a painting artist can get by with \nrelatively less fixed costs.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Variable costs are incurred in the act of producing.\n◦ For example, wages and cost to buy intermediate goods are variable costs.\n◦ The more you produce, the greater the variable cost.\n◦ Total cost = fixed cost + variable cost.\nThe nature of production\n◦ Two assumptions:\n1.

Demand curve\nDemand the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able \nto purchase at each price. \nDemand for each good and services can be obtained by individual consumer’s \npreference and their budgets.\nDemand represent the amount of wiliness to pay of the society. \n1. Demand curve\nThe total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity \ndemanded. \nSo, In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. \nDemand is mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities \ndemanded at those prices.\n1. Demand curve\nP         Q\nP         Q \nEconomists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity \ndemanded the law of demand. \nThe law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand are \nheld constant.\n1. Demand curve\nQ\nP\n1. Demand curve\nDemand curves can somewhat different for each product. \nThey may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. \nNearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope \ndown from left to right. \n2. Supply curve\nQuantity supplied means the amount of some good or service a producer is \nwilling to supply at each price. \nPrice is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. \nA rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of \nthat good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied.\n2. Supply curve\nQ\nP\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n18000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nWhat will be happened in next?\nSome chicken houses can not sell their chickens. So, Raw chickens, oils, flours \nat their storages starts to go bad.\nSome chicken houses will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a \nlower price than not to sell at all. \nSo, if the price is above the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to fall toward the equilibrium.\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n12000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nConsumers always are waiting their order and chicken houses says that they \nare filled with orders and there are no more stock of raw meats.\nIt’s not difficult for chicken houses to realize that even if they raise the price, \nthey can sell their stock out.\nSo, if the price is below the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to rise toward the equilibrium.\n4. Equilibrium\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nQ* = 1000\nP*\n=15000\nE\nE’\n4. Equilibrium\nThe word “equilibrium” means “balance.” \nIf a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason to \nmove away from that point. \nHowever, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise to \nmove the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.\n4. Equilibrium\nIn 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether \nsupply or demand determined a price was like arguing\n“whether it is the upper or the \nunder blade of a pair of \nscissors that cuts a piece of \npaper.” \n\n5. Shift of demand curve\nPrice, however, is not the only thing that influences demand and supply.\nWhat if overall consumer’s income has changed? \nSometime preferences can be suddenly changed.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \n5. Shift of demand curve\nQ\nP\nD0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nD1\nD2\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDoes the higher income always bring greater demand?\nA product whose demand rises when income rises is called a normal good.\nbut, there is a few exceptions to this pattern do exist. \nA product whose demand falls when income rises is called an inferior good. \n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnd, for some goods such as luxury cars, fine cuisines, or jewelry, the effect of \na rise in income can be especially pronounced.\nWe called those luxury goods.\nA luxury good is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally \nas income rises, \n5. Shift of demand curve\nOf course, income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand.\nWe can think about some of other factors that shift demand curves.\nOne of those is changing tastes or preferences.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \nIt might cause a severe avoiding to eat chickens.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDemographic changes can also be a important factor.\nActually, the demographic changes is combined with the changes in preference.\nSince the consumption preference of youth and old person is quite different, \nchanges in the demographic structure directly affects the overall preference of \nthe society.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnother example is the housing demand.\nSince the demand for owning houses is usually peaked in the middle age about \n40s, the overall housing demand can also be peaked, when the number of \nmiddle-aged in the country is the highest level.\nSome economists have tried to predict the future housing prices by using \npredictable demographic changes.\nMankiw, N. G., & Weil, D. N. (1989). The baby boom, the baby bust, and the \nhousing market. Regional science and urban economics, 19(2), 235-258.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nIt is also true that expectations about the future price (or expectations about \ntastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand.\nFor example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the \nstore to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. \nThese changes can push the demand curve to the right.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nOne interest thing is that some goods can be seriously affected by the \nexpectation.\nFor example, we can think about housing market.\nDemand for housing is not only determined  by preferences, but also by the \nexpectations for capital gain.\nThis feature of housing markets sometimes causes speculations in housing \nmarkets.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nHow about the supply curves? \nOne of most important factor affecting the supply curve might be the \nproduction cost.\nIf a firm faces lower costs of production, a firm’s profits go up. This can be \nshown by the supply curve shifting to the right.\nif a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any \ngiven selling price for its products. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the \nleft.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nQ\nP\nS0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nS1 S2\n6. Shift of supply curve\nSeveral other things affect the cost of production, too. \nWe can think about new technologies for production, and some government \npolicies.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nWhen producers develops or discovers a technology that allows the firm to \nproduce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right, as well. \nThink about the cost of raising a chicken in chicken farm and the poultry \nfactory system.\n\n6. Shift of supply curve\nGovernment policies also can affect the cost of production and the supply \ncurve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies.\nA subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces the \nfirm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. \nFrom the firm’s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of \nproduction that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower \nquantity at every given price. \nSo, government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at \nevery given price, shifting supply to the right.\n7. Price controls\nIn some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on politicians\n\n7. Price controls\nLaws that government enacts to regulate prices are called Price controls.\nPrice controls come in two ways.\nA price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level.\nAnd, a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n18000\n15000 E0\nE1\n1200\n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE2\n1500\n7. Price controls\nA price floor is the lowest legal price that can be paid in the market.\nPrice floors are sometimes called price supports. \nBecause they support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE’\n1500\nE\n7. Price controls\nThe demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the \nincentives provided by these laws to control prices.\nAs a result, It will often lead to undesirable consequences. \nIt implies alternative policy tools can often achieve the desired goals of price \ncontrol laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs."

Maximization of the objective under the constraint (rationality)\n2. Maximization of the utility subject to the budget constraint\n•  Marginal analysis\n3.  Derivation of a demand curve\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Suppose there is a consumer whose name is Pepe. He is the representative agent of all customers in our \nsociety.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• We want to capture that consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and \nwant.\n• Pepe has 5,600 wons in spending money each week.\n• He can allocate this spending between meal ticket and shirts. \n• The meal tickets cost 700 wons each, and the shirts are 1,400 wons each.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Of course, the budget constraint diagram containing just two goods is not realistic. \n• Because, in a modern economy, people choose from thousands of goods.\n• However, thinking about a model with many goods can be just a straightforward extension of what we \ndiscussed here.\n• The point is that there is always a trade-off problem in decisions.\n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket\n8\n4\n• Each point on the line of \nbudget constraint \nrepresents a combination \nof meal tickets and shirts, \nwhich the total cost adds \nup to Pepe’s budget of \n5,600 won. \nClothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• If he spend out his budget, we can \nthink his budget constraint is actually \nthe outer line of the colored area.\n• If he had unlimited income or goods \nwere free, then he could consume \nwithout limit.  \n• Any point outside the constraint is \nnot affordable, because it would cost \nmore money than Pepe has in his \nbudget.\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• It just means that,\n𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒.\n• In this case,\n• Income = 5,600 wons\n• Expenditure = 700 M + 1,400 S\n• So, 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• To draw it in a 2-D plane,\n➢5600 = 700M + 1400S\n➢700M = 5600 – 1400S\n➢M = 8 – 2S\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• The slope of the budget constraint is \ndetermined by the relative price. \n• Relative price - How many meal \ntickets would Pepe have to give up to \nget one more shirt, while staying \nwithin his budget?\n• All along the budget set, getting 1 \nshirt means giving up 2 meal tickets.\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Economists call it opportunity cost.\n• Opportunity cost indicate what have to be given up to obtain something. In other words, opportunity cost \nis the value of the next best alternative.\n• For Pepe, the opportunity cost of 1 shirt is the 2 meal tickets. \n• He would decide to buy one more shirt, If the value of the extra shirt exceed the value of the alternative \n(2 meal tickets).\n1. Budget Constraint\n• A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost.\n• If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost might be the time which would be spent \nto make up the class.\n• If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. \n• In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price.\n• For example, attending graduate school is the case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. \nThe explicit costs of attending college might be about tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. \nBut in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a \npaying job. Thus, graduate school imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost \nearnings.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if the price of a good changes?\n• Suppose that, the price of bus ticket increased to 1,400 won.\n• A price increase for bus tickets would have no effect on the ability to purchase Ramen. \n• But it would reduce the number of bus tickets which Pepe could afford to buy.\n• What happens in the budget constraint? Redraw it. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if Pepe’s income changes?\n• Suppose that, his income drops as a half(=2,800 won).\n• In this case, it would reduce the number of both of meal tickets and shirts which Pepe could afford to buy. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n4\n2\n1. Budget Constraint\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n2. Utility\n• People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility from using those goods and services.\n• Utility is the term which economists use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction/usefulness or \nhappiness with his or her choices.\n• Of course, in our daily life, we don’t measure such a thing. But, in model, it can be a quite useful \ninstrument to replicate the underlying incentive structure of each individuals.\n2. Utility\nEconomists assume the feature of utility\n1.The more of some good one consumes, the more utility \none obtains.\n2. As a person consumes more of a good, the additional (or \nmarginal) utility from each additional unit of the good \ndeclines.\n2. Utility\n• It is a general pattern that consumption of the first few units of good tends to bring a higher level of \nutility than consumption of later units.\n• Suppose that you are in thirsty. You can compare the degree to which the first few drops of water relieve \nthe thirst and the extent to which the drinking water later resolves the thirst.\n• Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility.\n• It means that, the utility of a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more \nthan the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.\n2. Utility\n• The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing \nchoices. \n• Most of people would not say, “My favorite food is potato, so I will eat nothing but only potatoes from \nnow on.”\n• Even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the marginal \nutility from those last few servings would not be very high. \n2. Utility\n• An example for the marginal utilities for meal ticket (and shirt):\n𝑀𝑈𝑀 = 1\n𝑀\n𝑀𝑈𝑆 = 1\n𝑆\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n• The marginal approach is based on looking at the tradeoffs(measured in terms of marginal utility per \nspending) of consuming less of one good and more of another.\n• Marginal utility of X = additional utility from consuming 1 more unit (the smallest unit we can imagine) \nof X\n• Which decision is better? Check the marginal utilities.\n• But we have to consider that the prices are different.\n• Relative price indicates how much unit of Y can be exchanged with 1 more X.\n• Marginal utility per spending of X = marginal utility of X / price of X\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 1\n• Which decision is better? Comparing the marginal utilities per spending.\n• Suppose an initial state of X,Y . What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ? Can he/she better off (by changing in decision for \nX,Y)? Yes. Suppose that he/she get more X by giving up some Y .\n• What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ?\n• After all adjustments, we derive the rule of maximization \n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\n• Note that there is no incentive to deviate from the equality condition.\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 2\n• Suppose that he/she starts to spend money from 0.\n• To make the best decision, he/she would choose the plan with a higher marginal utility per spending. For \nexample, if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n, he/she will choose X.\n• Note that the marginal utility of one good decreases as he/she consume more. If he/she consume X more \nand more, \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n. In that case, he/she can get more utility by getting more Y and giving up some X.\n• That means, if he/she is rational, he/she will stick to the condition,\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\nMarginal analysis\n: The rule of maximization\n• If there are other goods (which means, in more general terms),\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n= ⋯ =\n𝑴𝑼𝒁\n𝑷𝒁\n.\n• The rule of maximization captures several important characteristics of consumers in market economy.\n• The relationship among consumptions on different items.\n• The effect of price change\n• The effect of income change\n• How the shape of marginal utilities affect consumption plan (and how the consumption plan responses to income/price change)?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Budget constraint : 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nUtility function : 𝑀𝑈𝑀 = \n1\n𝑀, 𝑀𝑈𝑆 = \n1\n𝑆\n• What is the optimal choice for M, S?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Now, let’s suppose that the income goes up to 11,200 won.\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nIncome effect\n• Income effect and the characteristics of good\n• Normal goods : an increase in income causes an increase in demand (+)\n• Inferior goods : an increase in income causes a decrease in demand (-)\n• Luxury goods : an increase in income causes a bigger percentage increase in demand (++)\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• What if the price of M goes to 1400 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• If the price of S falls to 700 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 8 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n8\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• When a price changes,\n• Substitution effect : change in relative price (the slope in budget constraint)\n• Income effect (of a price change) : shift in real purchasing power\nPrice effect\n• Price effect : an increase in price causes an decrease in demand (-)\n* Special case : Giffen goods – price effect (+)\n• Relationship between goods\n• Substitute goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\n• Complementary goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• Then, consider price effect on other good\n• On substitute goods : an increase in the price of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• On complementary goods : an increase in the price of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\nDemand curve\n• What is demand curve? The relationship between price and quantity demanded\n• What is the quantity demanded? We know what occurs if consumers follow their self-interest. => The \noptimal decision of consumption\n• Remind that price effect is negative (-).\nThanks!!"

In the short run, we can classify the \ncosts into fixed costs and variable costs.\n◦ Fixed costs are the costs that cannot be changed in the short run.\n◦ Variable costs are the costs that can be changed.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of \nproduction, at least not in the short term.\n◦ For example, the cost of building factory or buying heavy equipment, research and \ndevelopment costs, advertising expenses. \n◦ The level of fixed costs varies according to the feature of the products or \nindustry. \n◦ For instance, manufacturing mobile phone or computer chips requires an \nexpensive factory. But, a food-truck or a painting artist can get by with \nrelatively less fixed costs.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Variable costs are incurred in the act of producing.\n◦ For example, wages and cost to buy intermediate goods are variable costs.\n◦ The more you produce, the greater the variable cost.\n◦ Total cost = fixed cost + variable cost.\nThe nature of production\n◦ Two assumptions:\n1. Positivity (with respect to input)\n2. Law of diminishing marginal production\n◦ Marginal product of any input : the additional quantity of output obtained \nfrom one additional unit of that input.\nExample : Pepe’s chicken house\n◦ Assume that the fixed costs of operating the chicken house, including the space and \nequipment, are 100.\n◦ The variable costs are the costs of hiring worker, which in our example is 50 per deliver. \n◦ Variable cost :  price of input  x  quantity of input.\n◦ When one unit of the input (worker) is added, the cost would be increased as much as the \nprice of the input (50 for the wage).\nExample : cost structure of the \nchicken house\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\n1 10\n2 18\n3 24\n4 28\n5 30\n6 31\n7 31.5\nThe law of diminishing marginal \nproduction\nExample : revenue of the chicken \nhouse\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nToral revenue Additional rev \n(from 1 more \nworker)\n1 10 300 300\n2 18 540 240\n3 24 720 180\n4 28 840 120\n5 30 900 60\n6 31 930 30\n7 31.5 945 15\nLet’s assume the \nprice of 1 chicken \n= 30!\nExample : cost structure of the \nchicken house\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nFixed cost Variable \ncost\nTotal cost Additional cost \n(1 worker)\n1 10 100 50 150 50\n2 18 100 100 200 50\n3 24 100 150 250 50\n4 28 100 200 300 50\n5 30 100 250 350 50\n6 31 100 300 400 50\n7 31.5 100 350 450 50\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nAdditional cost \n(1 worker)\nAdditional rev \n(1 worker)\n1 10 50 300\n2 18 50 240\n3 24 50 180\n4 28 50 120\n5 30 50 60\n6 31 50 30\n7 31.5 50 15\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nAdditional cost \n(1 worker)\nAdditional rev \n(1 worker)\n1 10 50 300\n2 18 50 240\n3 24 50 180\n4 28 50 120\n5 30 50 60\n6 31 50 30\n7 31.5 50 15\nMR = MC\nThe production function\n◦ We've discussed about the production cost, by using a \nproduction table.\n◦ Now, we can use the production function instead of the \nproduction table.\n◦ And then, from the production function, we can derive of each \ncost functions.\nThe production function\n◦ As the utility function, the form of the production function is \nusually assumed.\n◦ In our case, I assume a production function with the pattern of \ndiminishing marginal product.\n◦ Because this form is one of the basic form of production \nfunction which economists usually uses.\n• Functions and graphs\n• The concept of differentiation\n• Formulas for differentiation\nPreparations\n• Function : a special type of relation between X and Y .

Introduction\nIn this week, we will learn about:\n- Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for \nGoods and Services\n-   Shifts in Demand and Supply curves\n- Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity\n- Price Ceilings and Price Floors\nMarket Equilibrium\nFirm\n1\nFirm\n2\nFirm\n3\nFirm\n4\nFirm\n5\nGood & \nservice \nmarket\nProduction \nfactor \nmarket\n1. Demand curve\nDemand the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able \nto purchase at each price. \nDemand for each good and services can be obtained by individual consumer’s \npreference and their budgets.\nDemand represent the amount of wiliness to pay of the society. \n1. Demand curve\nThe total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity \ndemanded. \nSo, In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. \nDemand is mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities \ndemanded at those prices.\n1. Demand curve\nP         Q\nP         Q \nEconomists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity \ndemanded the law of demand. \nThe law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand are \nheld constant.\n1. Demand curve\nQ\nP\n1. Demand curve\nDemand curves can somewhat different for each product. \nThey may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. \nNearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope \ndown from left to right. \n2. Supply curve\nQuantity supplied means the amount of some good or service a producer is \nwilling to supply at each price. \nPrice is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. \nA rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of \nthat good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied.\n2. Supply curve\nQ\nP\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n18000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nWhat will be happened in next?\nSome chicken houses can not sell their chickens. So, Raw chickens, oils, flours \nat their storages starts to go bad.\nSome chicken houses will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a \nlower price than not to sell at all. \nSo, if the price is above the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to fall toward the equilibrium.\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n12000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nConsumers always are waiting their order and chicken houses says that they \nare filled with orders and there are no more stock of raw meats.\nIt’s not difficult for chicken houses to realize that even if they raise the price, \nthey can sell their stock out.\nSo, if the price is below the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to rise toward the equilibrium.\n4. Equilibrium\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nQ* = 1000\nP*\n=15000\nE\nE’\n4. Equilibrium\nThe word “equilibrium” means “balance.” \nIf a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason to \nmove away from that point. \nHowever, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise to \nmove the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.\n4. Equilibrium\nIn 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether \nsupply or demand determined a price was like arguing\n“whether it is the upper or the \nunder blade of a pair of \nscissors that cuts a piece of \npaper.” \n5. Shift of demand curve\nPrice, however, is not the only thing that influences demand and supply.\nWhat if overall consumer’s income has changed? \nSometime preferences can be suddenly changed.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \n5. Shift of demand curve\nQ\nP\nD0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nD1\nD2\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDoes the higher income always bring greater demand?\nA product whose demand rises when income rises is called a normal good.\nbut, there is a few exceptions to this pattern do exist. \nA product whose demand falls when income rises is called an inferior good. \n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnd, for some goods such as luxury cars, fine cuisines, or jewelry, the effect of \na rise in income can be especially pronounced.\nWe called those luxury goods.\nA luxury good is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally \nas income rises, \n5. Shift of demand curve\nOf course, income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand.\nWe can think about some of other factors that shift demand curves.\nOne of those is changing tastes or preferences.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \nIt might cause a severe avoiding to eat chickens.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDemographic changes can also be a important factor.\nActually, the demographic changes is combined with the changes in preference.\nSince the consumption preference of youth and old person is quite different, \nchanges in the demographic structure directly affects the overall preference of \nthe society.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnother example is the housing demand.\nSince the demand for owning houses is usually peaked in the middle age about \n40s, the overall housing demand can also be peaked, when the number of \nmiddle-aged in the country is the highest level.\nSome economists have tried to predict the future housing prices by using \npredictable demographic changes.\nMankiw, N. G., & Weil, D. N. (1989). The baby boom, the baby bust, and the \nhousing market. Regional science and urban economics, 19(2), 235-258.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nIt is also true that expectations about the future price (or expectations about \ntastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand.\nFor example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the \nstore to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. \nThese changes can push the demand curve to the right.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nOne interest thing is that some goods can be seriously affected by the \nexpectation.\nFor example, we can think about housing market.\nDemand for housing is not only determined  by preferences, but also by the \nexpectations for capital gain.\nThis feature of housing markets sometimes causes speculations in housing \nmarkets.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nHow about the supply curves? \nOne of most important factor affecting the supply curve might be the \nproduction cost.\nIf a firm faces lower costs of production, a firm’s profits go up. This can be \nshown by the supply curve shifting to the right.\nif a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any \ngiven selling price for its products. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the \nleft.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nQ\nP\nS0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nS1 S2\n6. Shift of supply curve\nSeveral other things affect the cost of production, too. \nWe can think about new technologies for production, and some government \npolicies.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nWhen producers develops or discovers a technology that allows the firm to \nproduce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right, as well. \nThink about the cost of raising a chicken in chicken farm and the poultry \nfactory system.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nGovernment policies also can affect the cost of production and the supply \ncurve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies.\nA subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces the \nfirm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. \nFrom the firm’s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of \nproduction that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower \nquantity at every given price. \nSo, government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at \nevery given price, shifting supply to the right.\n7. Price controls\nIn some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on politicians\n7. Price controls\nLaws that government enacts to regulate prices are called Price controls.\nPrice controls come in two ways.\nA price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level.\nAnd, a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n18000\n15000 E0\nE1\n1200\n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE2\n1500\n7. Price controls\nA price floor is the lowest legal price that can be paid in the market.\nPrice floors are sometimes called price supports. \nBecause they support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE’\n1500\nE\n7. Price controls\nThe demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the \nincentives provided by these laws to control prices.\nAs a result, It will often lead to undesirable consequences. \nIt implies alternative policy tools can often achieve the desired goals of price \ncontrol laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs."

Model description \n•  What they can choose? Budget constraint\n•  What is their objective? Utility function\n•  How do they behave? Maximization of the objective under the constraint (rationality)\n2. Maximization of the utility subject to the budget constraint\n•  Marginal analysis\n3.  Derivation of a demand curve\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Suppose there is a consumer whose name is Pepe. He is the representative agent of all customers in our \nsociety.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• We want to capture that consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and \nwant.\n• Pepe has 5,600 wons in spending money each week.\n• He can allocate this spending between meal ticket and shirts. \n• The meal tickets cost 700 wons each, and the shirts are 1,400 wons each.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Of course, the budget constraint diagram containing just two goods is not realistic. \n• Because, in a modern economy, people choose from thousands of goods.\n• However, thinking about a model with many goods can be just a straightforward extension of what we \ndiscussed here.\n• The point is that there is always a trade-off problem in decisions.\n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket\n8\n4\n• Each point on the line of \nbudget constraint \nrepresents a combination \nof meal tickets and shirts, \nwhich the total cost adds \nup to Pepe’s budget of \n5,600 won. \nClothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• If he spend out his budget, we can \nthink his budget constraint is actually \nthe outer line of the colored area.\n• If he had unlimited income or goods \nwere free, then he could consume \nwithout limit.  \n• Any point outside the constraint is \nnot affordable, because it would cost \nmore money than Pepe has in his \nbudget.\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• It just means that,\n𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒.\n• In this case,\n• Income = 5,600 wons\n• Expenditure = 700 M + 1,400 S\n• So, 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• To draw it in a 2-D plane,\n➢5600 = 700M + 1400S\n➢700M = 5600 – 1400S\n➢M = 8 – 2S\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• The slope of the budget constraint is \ndetermined by the relative price. \n• Relative price - How many meal \ntickets would Pepe have to give up to \nget one more shirt, while staying \nwithin his budget?\n• All along the budget set, getting 1 \nshirt means giving up 2 meal tickets.\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Economists call it opportunity cost.\n• Opportunity cost indicate what have to be given up to obtain something. In other words, opportunity cost \nis the value of the next best alternative.\n• For Pepe, the opportunity cost of 1 shirt is the 2 meal tickets. \n• He would decide to buy one more shirt, If the value of the extra shirt exceed the value of the alternative \n(2 meal tickets).\n1. Budget Constraint\n• A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost.\n• If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost might be the time which would be spent \nto make up the class.\n• If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. \n• In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price.\n• For example, attending graduate school is the case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. \nThe explicit costs of attending college might be about tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. \nBut in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a \npaying job. Thus, graduate school imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost \nearnings.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if the price of a good changes?\n• Suppose that, the price of bus ticket increased to 1,400 won.\n• A price increase for bus tickets would have no effect on the ability to purchase Ramen. \n• But it would reduce the number of bus tickets which Pepe could afford to buy.\n• What happens in the budget constraint?

Budget Constraint\n• What if Pepe’s income changes?\n• Suppose that, his income drops as a half(=2,800 won).\n• In this case, it would reduce the number of both of meal tickets and shirts which Pepe could afford to buy. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n4\n2\n1. Budget Constraint\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n2. Utility\n• People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility from using those goods and services.\n• Utility is the term which economists use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction/usefulness or \nhappiness with his or her choices.\n• Of course, in our daily life, we don’t measure such a thing. But, in model, it can be a quite useful \ninstrument to replicate the underlying incentive structure of each individuals.\n2. Utility\nEconomists assume the feature of utility\n1.The more of some good one consumes, the more utility \none obtains.\n2. As a person consumes more of a good, the additional (or \nmarginal) utility from each additional unit of the good \ndeclines.\n2. Utility\n• It is a general pattern that consumption of the first few units of good tends to bring a higher level of \nutility than consumption of later units.\n• Suppose that you are in thirsty. You can compare the degree to which the first few drops of water relieve \nthe thirst and the extent to which the drinking water later resolves the thirst.\n• Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility.\n• It means that, the utility of a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more \nthan the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.\n2. Utility\n• The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing \nchoices. \n• Most of people would not say, “My favorite food is potato, so I will eat nothing but only potatoes from \nnow on.”\n• Even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the marginal \nutility from those last few servings would not be very high. \n2. Utility\n• An example for the marginal utilities for meal ticket (and shirt):\n𝑀𝑈𝑀 = 1\n𝑀\n𝑀𝑈𝑆 = 1\n𝑆\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n• The marginal approach is based on looking at the tradeoffs(measured in terms of marginal utility per \nspending) of consuming less of one good and more of another.\n• Marginal utility of X = additional utility from consuming 1 more unit (the smallest unit we can imagine) \nof X\n• Which decision is better? Check the marginal utilities.\n• But we have to consider that the prices are different.\n• Relative price indicates how much unit of Y can be exchanged with 1 more X.\n• Marginal utility per spending of X = marginal utility of X / price of X\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 1\n• Which decision is better? Comparing the marginal utilities per spending.\n• Suppose an initial state of X,Y . What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ? Can he/she better off (by changing in decision for \nX,Y)? Yes. Suppose that he/she get more X by giving up some Y .\n• What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ?\n• After all adjustments, we derive the rule of maximization \n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\n• Note that there is no incentive to deviate from the equality condition.\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 2\n• Suppose that he/she starts to spend money from 0.\n• To make the best decision, he/she would choose the plan with a higher marginal utility per spending. For \nexample, if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n, he/she will choose X.\n• Note that the marginal utility of one good decreases as he/she consume more. If he/she consume X more \nand more, \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n. In that case, he/she can get more utility by getting more Y and giving up some X.\n• That means, if he/she is rational, he/she will stick to the condition,\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\nMarginal analysis\n: The rule of maximization\n• If there are other goods (which means, in more general terms),\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n= ⋯ =\n𝑴𝑼𝒁\n𝑷𝒁\n.\n• The rule of maximization captures several important characteristics of consumers in market economy.\n• The relationship among consumptions on different items.\n• The effect of price change\n• The effect of income change\n• How the shape of marginal utilities affect consumption plan (and how the consumption plan responses to income/price change)?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Budget constraint : 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nUtility function : 𝑀𝑈𝑀 = \n1\n𝑀, 𝑀𝑈𝑆 = \n1\n𝑆\n• What is the optimal choice for M, S?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Now, let’s suppose that the income goes up to 11,200 won.\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nIncome effect\n• Income effect and the characteristics of good\n• Normal goods : an increase in income causes an increase in demand (+)\n• Inferior goods : an increase in income causes a decrease in demand (-)\n• Luxury goods : an increase in income causes a bigger percentage increase in demand (++)\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• What if the price of M goes to 1400 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• If the price of S falls to 700 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 8 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n8\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• When a price changes,\n• Substitution effect : change in relative price (the slope in budget constraint)\n• Income effect (of a price change) : shift in real purchasing power\nPrice effect\n• Price effect : an increase in price causes an decrease in demand (-)\n* Special case : Giffen goods – price effect (+)\n• Relationship between goods\n• Substitute goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\n• Complementary goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• Then, consider price effect on other good\n• On substitute goods : an increase in the price of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• On complementary goods : an increase in the price of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\nDemand curve\n• What is demand curve?

In the short run, we can classify the \ncosts into fixed costs and variable costs.\n◦ Fixed costs are the costs that cannot be changed in the short run.\n◦ Variable costs are the costs that can be changed.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of \nproduction, at least not in the short term.\n◦ For example, the cost of building factory or buying heavy equipment, research and \ndevelopment costs, advertising expenses. \n◦ The level of fixed costs varies according to the feature of the products or \nindustry. \n◦ For instance, manufacturing mobile phone or computer chips requires an \nexpensive factory. But, a food-truck or a painting artist can get by with \nrelatively less fixed costs.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Variable costs are incurred in the act of producing.\n◦ For example, wages and cost to buy intermediate goods are variable costs.\n◦ The more you produce, the greater the variable cost.\n◦ Total cost = fixed cost + variable cost.\nThe nature of production\n◦ Two assumptions:\n1.

Introduction\nIn this week, we will learn about:\n- Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for \nGoods and Services\n-   Shifts in Demand and Supply curves\n- Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity\n- Price Ceilings and Price Floors\nMarket Equilibrium\nFirm\n1\nFirm\n2\nFirm\n3\nFirm\n4\nFirm\n5\nGood & \nservice \nmarket\nProduction \nfactor \nmarket\n1. Demand curve\nDemand the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able \nto purchase at each price. \nDemand for each good and services can be obtained by individual consumer’s \npreference and their budgets.\nDemand represent the amount of wiliness to pay of the society. \n1. Demand curve\nThe total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity \ndemanded. \nSo, In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. \nDemand is mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities \ndemanded at those prices.\n1. Demand curve\nP         Q\nP         Q \nEconomists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity \ndemanded the law of demand. \nThe law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand are \nheld constant.\n1. Demand curve\nQ\nP\n1. Demand curve\nDemand curves can somewhat different for each product. \nThey may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. \nNearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope \ndown from left to right. \n2. Supply curve\nQuantity supplied means the amount of some good or service a producer is \nwilling to supply at each price. \nPrice is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. \nA rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of \nthat good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied.\n2. Supply curve\nQ\nP\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n18000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nWhat will be happened in next?\nSome chicken houses can not sell their chickens. So, Raw chickens, oils, flours \nat their storages starts to go bad.\nSome chicken houses will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a \nlower price than not to sell at all. \nSo, if the price is above the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to fall toward the equilibrium.\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n12000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nConsumers always are waiting their order and chicken houses says that they \nare filled with orders and there are no more stock of raw meats.\nIt’s not difficult for chicken houses to realize that even if they raise the price, \nthey can sell their stock out.\nSo, if the price is below the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to rise toward the equilibrium.\n4. Equilibrium\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nQ* = 1000\nP*\n=15000\nE\nE’\n4. Equilibrium\nThe word “equilibrium” means “balance.” \nIf a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason to \nmove away from that point. \nHowever, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise to \nmove the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.\n4. Equilibrium\nIn 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether \nsupply or demand determined a price was like arguing\n“whether it is the upper or the \nunder blade of a pair of \nscissors that cuts a piece of \npaper.” \n5. Shift of demand curve\nPrice, however, is not the only thing that influences demand and supply.\nWhat if overall consumer’s income has changed? \nSometime preferences can be suddenly changed.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \n5. Shift of demand curve\nQ\nP\nD0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nD1\nD2\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDoes the higher income always bring greater demand?\nA product whose demand rises when income rises is called a normal good.\nbut, there is a few exceptions to this pattern do exist. \nA product whose demand falls when income rises is called an inferior good. \n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnd, for some goods such as luxury cars, fine cuisines, or jewelry, the effect of \na rise in income can be especially pronounced.\nWe called those luxury goods.\nA luxury good is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally \nas income rises, \n5. Shift of demand curve\nOf course, income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand.\nWe can think about some of other factors that shift demand curves.\nOne of those is changing tastes or preferences.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \nIt might cause a severe avoiding to eat chickens.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDemographic changes can also be a important factor.\nActually, the demographic changes is combined with the changes in preference.\nSince the consumption preference of youth and old person is quite different, \nchanges in the demographic structure directly affects the overall preference of \nthe society.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnother example is the housing demand.\nSince the demand for owning houses is usually peaked in the middle age about \n40s, the overall housing demand can also be peaked, when the number of \nmiddle-aged in the country is the highest level.\nSome economists have tried to predict the future housing prices by using \npredictable demographic changes.\nMankiw, N. G., & Weil, D. N. (1989). The baby boom, the baby bust, and the \nhousing market. Regional science and urban economics, 19(2), 235-258.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nIt is also true that expectations about the future price (or expectations about \ntastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand.\nFor example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the \nstore to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. \nThese changes can push the demand curve to the right.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nOne interest thing is that some goods can be seriously affected by the \nexpectation.\nFor example, we can think about housing market.\nDemand for housing is not only determined  by preferences, but also by the \nexpectations for capital gain.\nThis feature of housing markets sometimes causes speculations in housing \nmarkets.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nHow about the supply curves? \nOne of most important factor affecting the supply curve might be the \nproduction cost.\nIf a firm faces lower costs of production, a firm’s profits go up. This can be \nshown by the supply curve shifting to the right.\nif a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any \ngiven selling price for its products. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the \nleft.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nQ\nP\nS0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nS1 S2\n6. Shift of supply curve\nSeveral other things affect the cost of production, too. \nWe can think about new technologies for production, and some government \npolicies.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nWhen producers develops or discovers a technology that allows the firm to \nproduce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right, as well. \nThink about the cost of raising a chicken in chicken farm and the poultry \nfactory system.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nGovernment policies also can affect the cost of production and the supply \ncurve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies.\nA subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces the \nfirm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. \nFrom the firm’s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of \nproduction that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower \nquantity at every given price. \nSo, government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at \nevery given price, shifting supply to the right.\n7. Price controls\nIn some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on politicians\n7. Price controls\nLaws that government enacts to regulate prices are called Price controls.\nPrice controls come in two ways.\nA price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level.\nAnd, a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n18000\n15000 E0\nE1\n1200\n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE2\n1500\n7. Price controls\nA price floor is the lowest legal price that can be paid in the market.\nPrice floors are sometimes called price supports. \nBecause they support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE’\n1500\nE\n7. Price controls\nThe demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the \nincentives provided by these laws to control prices.\nAs a result, It will often lead to undesirable consequences. \nIt implies alternative policy tools can often achieve the desired goals of price \ncontrol laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs."

Maximization of the objective under the constraint (rationality)\n2. Maximization of the utility subject to the budget constraint\n•  Marginal analysis\n3.  Derivation of a demand curve\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Suppose there is a consumer whose name is Pepe. He is the representative agent of all customers in our \nsociety.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• We want to capture that consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and \nwant.\n• Pepe has 5,600 wons in spending money each week.\n• He can allocate this spending between meal ticket and shirts. \n• The meal tickets cost 700 wons each, and the shirts are 1,400 wons each.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Of course, the budget constraint diagram containing just two goods is not realistic. \n• Because, in a modern economy, people choose from thousands of goods.\n• However, thinking about a model with many goods can be just a straightforward extension of what we \ndiscussed here.\n• The point is that there is always a trade-off problem in decisions.\n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket\n8\n4\n• Each point on the line of \nbudget constraint \nrepresents a combination \nof meal tickets and shirts, \nwhich the total cost adds \nup to Pepe’s budget of \n5,600 won. \nClothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• If he spend out his budget, we can \nthink his budget constraint is actually \nthe outer line of the colored area.\n• If he had unlimited income or goods \nwere free, then he could consume \nwithout limit.  \n• Any point outside the constraint is \nnot affordable, because it would cost \nmore money than Pepe has in his \nbudget.\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• It just means that,\n𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒.\n• In this case,\n• Income = 5,600 wons\n• Expenditure = 700 M + 1,400 S\n• So, 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• To draw it in a 2-D plane,\n➢5600 = 700M + 1400S\n➢700M = 5600 – 1400S\n➢M = 8 – 2S\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• The slope of the budget constraint is \ndetermined by the relative price. \n• Relative price - How many meal \ntickets would Pepe have to give up to \nget one more shirt, while staying \nwithin his budget?\n• All along the budget set, getting 1 \nshirt means giving up 2 meal tickets.\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Economists call it opportunity cost.\n• Opportunity cost indicate what have to be given up to obtain something. In other words, opportunity cost \nis the value of the next best alternative.\n• For Pepe, the opportunity cost of 1 shirt is the 2 meal tickets. \n• He would decide to buy one more shirt, If the value of the extra shirt exceed the value of the alternative \n(2 meal tickets).\n1. Budget Constraint\n• A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost.\n• If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost might be the time which would be spent \nto make up the class.\n• If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. \n• In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price.\n• For example, attending graduate school is the case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. \nThe explicit costs of attending college might be about tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. \nBut in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a \npaying job. Thus, graduate school imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost \nearnings.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if the price of a good changes?\n• Suppose that, the price of bus ticket increased to 1,400 won.\n• A price increase for bus tickets would have no effect on the ability to purchase Ramen. \n• But it would reduce the number of bus tickets which Pepe could afford to buy.\n• What happens in the budget constraint? Redraw it. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if Pepe’s income changes?\n• Suppose that, his income drops as a half(=2,800 won).\n• In this case, it would reduce the number of both of meal tickets and shirts which Pepe could afford to buy. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n4\n2\n1. Budget Constraint\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n2. Utility\n• People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility from using those goods and services.\n• Utility is the term which economists use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction/usefulness or \nhappiness with his or her choices.\n• Of course, in our daily life, we don’t measure such a thing. But, in model, it can be a quite useful \ninstrument to replicate the underlying incentive structure of each individuals.\n2. Utility\nEconomists assume the feature of utility\n1.The more of some good one consumes, the more utility \none obtains.\n2. As a person consumes more of a good, the additional (or \nmarginal) utility from each additional unit of the good \ndeclines.\n2. Utility\n• It is a general pattern that consumption of the first few units of good tends to bring a higher level of \nutility than consumption of later units.\n• Suppose that you are in thirsty. You can compare the degree to which the first few drops of water relieve \nthe thirst and the extent to which the drinking water later resolves the thirst.\n• Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility.\n• It means that, the utility of a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more \nthan the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.\n2. Utility\n• The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing \nchoices. \n• Most of people would not say, “My favorite food is potato, so I will eat nothing but only potatoes from \nnow on.”\n• Even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the marginal \nutility from those last few servings would not be very high. \n2. Utility\n• An example for the marginal utilities for meal ticket (and shirt):\n𝑀𝑈𝑀 = 1\n𝑀\n𝑀𝑈𝑆 = 1\n𝑆\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n• The marginal approach is based on looking at the tradeoffs(measured in terms of marginal utility per \nspending) of consuming less of one good and more of another.\n• Marginal utility of X = additional utility from consuming 1 more unit (the smallest unit we can imagine) \nof X\n• Which decision is better? Check the marginal utilities.\n• But we have to consider that the prices are different.\n• Relative price indicates how much unit of Y can be exchanged with 1 more X.\n• Marginal utility per spending of X = marginal utility of X / price of X\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 1\n• Which decision is better? Comparing the marginal utilities per spending.\n• Suppose an initial state of X,Y . What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ? Can he/she better off (by changing in decision for \nX,Y)? Yes. Suppose that he/she get more X by giving up some Y .\n• What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ?\n• After all adjustments, we derive the rule of maximization \n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\n• Note that there is no incentive to deviate from the equality condition.\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 2\n• Suppose that he/she starts to spend money from 0.\n• To make the best decision, he/she would choose the plan with a higher marginal utility per spending. For \nexample, if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n, he/she will choose X.\n• Note that the marginal utility of one good decreases as he/she consume more. If he/she consume X more \nand more, \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n. In that case, he/she can get more utility by getting more Y and giving up some X.\n• That means, if he/she is rational, he/she will stick to the condition,\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\nMarginal analysis\n: The rule of maximization\n• If there are other goods (which means, in more general terms),\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n= ⋯ =\n𝑴𝑼𝒁\n𝑷𝒁\n.\n• The rule of maximization captures several important characteristics of consumers in market economy.\n• The relationship among consumptions on different items.\n• The effect of price change\n• The effect of income change\n• How the shape of marginal utilities affect consumption plan (and how the consumption plan responses to income/price change)?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Budget constraint : 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nUtility function : 𝑀𝑈𝑀 = \n1\n𝑀, 𝑀𝑈𝑆 = \n1\n𝑆\n• What is the optimal choice for M, S?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Now, let’s suppose that the income goes up to 11,200 won.\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nIncome effect\n• Income effect and the characteristics of good\n• Normal goods : an increase in income causes an increase in demand (+)\n• Inferior goods : an increase in income causes a decrease in demand (-)\n• Luxury goods : an increase in income causes a bigger percentage increase in demand (++)\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• What if the price of M goes to 1400 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• If the price of S falls to 700 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 8 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n8\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• When a price changes,\n• Substitution effect : change in relative price (the slope in budget constraint)\n• Income effect (of a price change) : shift in real purchasing power\nPrice effect\n• Price effect : an increase in price causes an decrease in demand (-)\n* Special case : Giffen goods – price effect (+)\n• Relationship between goods\n• Substitute goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\n• Complementary goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• Then, consider price effect on other good\n• On substitute goods : an increase in the price of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• On complementary goods : an increase in the price of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\nDemand curve\n• What is demand curve?

In the short run, we can classify the \ncosts into fixed costs and variable costs.\n◦ Fixed costs are the costs that cannot be changed in the short run.\n◦ Variable costs are the costs that can be changed.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of \nproduction, at least not in the short term.\n◦ For example, the cost of building factory or buying heavy equipment, research and \ndevelopment costs, advertising expenses. \n◦ The level of fixed costs varies according to the feature of the products or \nindustry. \n◦ For instance, manufacturing mobile phone or computer chips requires an \nexpensive factory. But, a food-truck or a painting artist can get by with \nrelatively less fixed costs.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Variable costs are incurred in the act of producing.\n◦ For example, wages and cost to buy intermediate goods are variable costs.\n◦ The more you produce, the greater the variable cost.\n◦ Total cost = fixed cost + variable cost.\nThe nature of production\n◦ Two assumptions:\n1.

Introduction\nIn this week, we will learn about:\n- Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for \nGoods and Services\n-   Shifts in Demand and Supply curves\n- Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity\n- Price Ceilings and Price Floors\nMarket Equilibrium\nFirm\n1\nFirm\n2\nFirm\n3\nFirm\n4\nFirm\n5\nGood & \nservice \nmarket\nProduction \nfactor \nmarket\n1. Demand curve\nDemand the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able \nto purchase at each price. \nDemand for each good and services can be obtained by individual consumer’s \npreference and their budgets.\nDemand represent the amount of wiliness to pay of the society. \n1. Demand curve\nThe total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity \ndemanded. \nSo, In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. \nDemand is mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities \ndemanded at those prices.\n1. Demand curve\nP         Q\nP         Q \nEconomists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity \ndemanded the law of demand. \nThe law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand are \nheld constant.\n1. Demand curve\nQ\nP\n1. Demand curve\nDemand curves can somewhat different for each product. \nThey may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. \nNearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope \ndown from left to right. \n2. Supply curve\nQuantity supplied means the amount of some good or service a producer is \nwilling to supply at each price. \nPrice is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. \nA rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of \nthat good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied.\n2. Supply curve\nQ\nP\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n18000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nWhat will be happened in next?\nSome chicken houses can not sell their chickens. So, Raw chickens, oils, flours \nat their storages starts to go bad.\nSome chicken houses will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a \nlower price than not to sell at all. \nSo, if the price is above the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to fall toward the equilibrium.\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n12000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nConsumers always are waiting their order and chicken houses says that they \nare filled with orders and there are no more stock of raw meats.\nIt’s not difficult for chicken houses to realize that even if they raise the price, \nthey can sell their stock out.\nSo, if the price is below the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to rise toward the equilibrium.\n4. Equilibrium\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nQ* = 1000\nP*\n=15000\nE\nE’\n4. Equilibrium\nThe word “equilibrium” means “balance.” \nIf a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason to \nmove away from that point. \nHowever, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise to \nmove the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.\n4. Equilibrium\nIn 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether \nsupply or demand determined a price was like arguing\n“whether it is the upper or the \nunder blade of a pair of \nscissors that cuts a piece of \npaper.” \n5. Shift of demand curve\nPrice, however, is not the only thing that influences demand and supply.\nWhat if overall consumer’s income has changed? \nSometime preferences can be suddenly changed.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \n5. Shift of demand curve\nQ\nP\nD0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nD1\nD2\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDoes the higher income always bring greater demand?\nA product whose demand rises when income rises is called a normal good.\nbut, there is a few exceptions to this pattern do exist. \nA product whose demand falls when income rises is called an inferior good. \n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnd, for some goods such as luxury cars, fine cuisines, or jewelry, the effect of \na rise in income can be especially pronounced.\nWe called those luxury goods.\nA luxury good is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally \nas income rises, \n5. Shift of demand curve\nOf course, income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand.\nWe can think about some of other factors that shift demand curves.\nOne of those is changing tastes or preferences.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \nIt might cause a severe avoiding to eat chickens.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDemographic changes can also be a important factor.\nActually, the demographic changes is combined with the changes in preference.\nSince the consumption preference of youth and old person is quite different, \nchanges in the demographic structure directly affects the overall preference of \nthe society.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnother example is the housing demand.\nSince the demand for owning houses is usually peaked in the middle age about \n40s, the overall housing demand can also be peaked, when the number of \nmiddle-aged in the country is the highest level.\nSome economists have tried to predict the future housing prices by using \npredictable demographic changes.\nMankiw, N. G., & Weil, D. N. (1989). The baby boom, the baby bust, and the \nhousing market. Regional science and urban economics, 19(2), 235-258.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nIt is also true that expectations about the future price (or expectations about \ntastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand.\nFor example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the \nstore to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. \nThese changes can push the demand curve to the right.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nOne interest thing is that some goods can be seriously affected by the \nexpectation.\nFor example, we can think about housing market.\nDemand for housing is not only determined  by preferences, but also by the \nexpectations for capital gain.\nThis feature of housing markets sometimes causes speculations in housing \nmarkets.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nHow about the supply curves? \nOne of most important factor affecting the supply curve might be the \nproduction cost.\nIf a firm faces lower costs of production, a firm’s profits go up. This can be \nshown by the supply curve shifting to the right.\nif a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any \ngiven selling price for its products. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the \nleft.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nQ\nP\nS0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nS1 S2\n6. Shift of supply curve\nSeveral other things affect the cost of production, too. \nWe can think about new technologies for production, and some government \npolicies.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nWhen producers develops or discovers a technology that allows the firm to \nproduce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right, as well. \nThink about the cost of raising a chicken in chicken farm and the poultry \nfactory system.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nGovernment policies also can affect the cost of production and the supply \ncurve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies.\nA subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces the \nfirm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. \nFrom the firm’s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of \nproduction that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower \nquantity at every given price. \nSo, government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at \nevery given price, shifting supply to the right.\n7. Price controls\nIn some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on politicians\n7. Price controls\nLaws that government enacts to regulate prices are called Price controls.\nPrice controls come in two ways.\nA price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level.\nAnd, a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n18000\n15000 E0\nE1\n1200\n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE2\n1500\n7. Price controls\nA price floor is the lowest legal price that can be paid in the market.\nPrice floors are sometimes called price supports. \nBecause they support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE’\n1500\nE\n7. Price controls\nThe demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the \nincentives provided by these laws to control prices.\nAs a result, It will often lead to undesirable consequences. \nIt implies alternative policy tools can often achieve the desired goals of price \ncontrol laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs."

Budget Constraint\n• Suppose there is a consumer whose name is Pepe. He is the representative agent of all customers in our \nsociety.\n\n1. Budget Constraint\n• We want to capture that consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and \nwant.\n• Pepe has 5,600 wons in spending money each week.\n• He can allocate this spending between meal ticket and shirts. \n• The meal tickets cost 700 wons each, and the shirts are 1,400 wons each.\n\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Of course, the budget constraint diagram containing just two goods is not realistic. \n• Because, in a modern economy, people choose from thousands of goods.\n• However, thinking about a model with many goods can be just a straightforward extension of what we \ndiscussed here.\n• The point is that there is always a trade-off problem in decisions.\n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket\n8\n4\n• Each point on the line of \nbudget constraint \nrepresents a combination \nof meal tickets and shirts, \nwhich the total cost adds \nup to Pepe’s budget of \n5,600 won. \nClothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• If he spend out his budget, we can \nthink his budget constraint is actually \nthe outer line of the colored area.\n• If he had unlimited income or goods \nwere free, then he could consume \nwithout limit.  \n• Any point outside the constraint is \nnot affordable, because it would cost \nmore money than Pepe has in his \nbudget.\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• It just means that,\n𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒.\n• In this case,\n• Income = 5,600 wons\n• Expenditure = 700 M + 1,400 S\n• So, 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• To draw it in a 2-D plane,\n➢5600 = 700M + 1400S\n➢700M = 5600 – 1400S\n➢M = 8 – 2S\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• The slope of the budget constraint is \ndetermined by the relative price. \n• Relative price - How many meal \ntickets would Pepe have to give up to \nget one more shirt, while staying \nwithin his budget?\n• All along the budget set, getting 1 \nshirt means giving up 2 meal tickets.\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Economists call it opportunity cost.\n• Opportunity cost indicate what have to be given up to obtain something. In other words, opportunity cost \nis the value of the next best alternative.\n• For Pepe, the opportunity cost of 1 shirt is the 2 meal tickets. \n• He would decide to buy one more shirt, If the value of the extra shirt exceed the value of the alternative \n(2 meal tickets).\n1. Budget Constraint\n• A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost.\n• If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost might be the time which would be spent \nto make up the class.\n• If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. \n• In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price.\n• For example, attending graduate school is the case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. \nThe explicit costs of attending college might be about tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. \nBut in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a \npaying job. Thus, graduate school imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost \nearnings.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if the price of a good changes?\n• Suppose that, the price of bus ticket increased to 1,400 won.\n• A price increase for bus tickets would have no effect on the ability to purchase Ramen. \n• But it would reduce the number of bus tickets which Pepe could afford to buy.\n• What happens in the budget constraint? Redraw it. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if Pepe’s income changes?\n• Suppose that, his income drops as a half(=2,800 won).\n• In this case, it would reduce the number of both of meal tickets and shirts which Pepe could afford to buy. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n4\n2\n1. Budget Constraint\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n2. Utility\n• People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility from using those goods and services.\n• Utility is the term which economists use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction/usefulness or \nhappiness with his or her choices.\n• Of course, in our daily life, we don’t measure such a thing. But, in model, it can be a quite useful \ninstrument to replicate the underlying incentive structure of each individuals.\n2. Utility\nEconomists assume the feature of utility\n1.The more of some good one consumes, the more utility \none obtains.\n2. As a person consumes more of a good, the additional (or \nmarginal) utility from each additional unit of the good \ndeclines.\n2. Utility\n• It is a general pattern that consumption of the first few units of good tends to bring a higher level of \nutility than consumption of later units.\n• Suppose that you are in thirsty. You can compare the degree to which the first few drops of water relieve \nthe thirst and the extent to which the drinking water later resolves the thirst.\n• Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility.\n• It means that, the utility of a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more \nthan the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.\n2. Utility\n• The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing \nchoices. \n• Most of people would not say, “My favorite food is potato, so I will eat nothing but only potatoes from \nnow on.”\n• Even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the marginal \nutility from those last few servings would not be very high. \n2. Utility\n• An example for the marginal utilities for meal ticket (and shirt):\n𝑀𝑈𝑀 = 1\n𝑀\n𝑀𝑈𝑆 = 1\n𝑆\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n• The marginal approach is based on looking at the tradeoffs(measured in terms of marginal utility per \nspending) of consuming less of one good and more of another.\n• Marginal utility of X = additional utility from consuming 1 more unit (the smallest unit we can imagine) \nof X\n• Which decision is better? Check the marginal utilities.\n• But we have to consider that the prices are different.\n• Relative price indicates how much unit of Y can be exchanged with 1 more X.\n• Marginal utility per spending of X = marginal utility of X / price of X\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 1\n• Which decision is better? Comparing the marginal utilities per spending.\n• Suppose an initial state of X,Y . What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n>\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ? Can he/she better off (by changing in decision for \nX,Y)? Yes. Suppose that he/she get more X by giving up some Y . \n• What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n<\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ?\n• After all adjustments, we derive the rule of maximization \n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\n• Note that there is no incentive to deviate from the equality condition.\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 2\n• Suppose that he/she starts to spend money from 0.\n• To make the best decision, he/she would choose the plan with a higher marginal utility per spending. For \nexample, if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n>\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n, he/she will choose X.\n• Note that the marginal utility of one good decreases as he/she consume more. If he/she consume X more \nand more, \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n<\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n. In that case, he/she can get more utility by getting more Y and giving up some X.\n• That means, if he/she is rational, he/she will stick to the condition,\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\nMarginal analysis\n: The rule of maximization\n• If there are other goods (which means, in more general terms),\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n= ⋯ =\n𝑴𝑼𝒁\n𝑷𝒁\n.\n• The rule of maximization captures several important characteristics of consumers in market economy.\n• The relationship among consumptions on different items.\n• The effect of price change\n• The effect of income change\n• How the shape of marginal utilities affect consumption plan (and how the consumption plan responses to income/price change)?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Budget constraint : 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nUtility function : 𝑀𝑈𝑀 =\n1\n𝑀, 𝑀𝑈𝑆 =\n1\n𝑆\n• What is the optimal choice for M, S?\n\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Now, let’s suppose that the income goes up to 11,200 won.\n\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nIncome effect\n• Income effect and the characteristics of good\n• Normal goods : an increase in income causes an increase in demand (+)\n• Inferior goods : an increase in income causes a decrease in demand (-)\n• Luxury goods : an increase in income causes a bigger percentage increase in demand (++)\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• What if the price of M goes to 1400 won ?\n\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• If the price of S falls to 700 won ?\n\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 8 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n8\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• When a price changes,\n• Substitution effect : change in relative price (the slope in budget constraint)\n• Income effect (of a price change) : shift in real purchasing power\n\nPrice effect\n• Price effect : an increase in price causes an decrease in demand (-)\n* Special case : Giffen goods – price effect (+)\n• Relationship between goods\n• Substitute goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\n• Complementary goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• Then, consider price effect on other good\n• On substitute goods : an increase in the price of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• On complementary goods : an increase in the price of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\nDemand curve\n• What is demand curve?

In the short run, we can classify the \ncosts into fixed costs and variable costs.\n◦ Fixed costs are the costs that cannot be changed in the short run.\n◦ Variable costs are the costs that can be changed.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of \nproduction, at least not in the short term.\n◦ For example, the cost of building factory or buying heavy equipment, research and \ndevelopment costs, advertising expenses. \n◦ The level of fixed costs varies according to the feature of the products or \nindustry. \n◦ For instance, manufacturing mobile phone or computer chips requires an \nexpensive factory. But, a food-truck or a painting artist can get by with \nrelatively less fixed costs.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Variable costs are incurred in the act of producing.\n◦ For example, wages and cost to buy intermediate goods are variable costs.\n◦ The more you produce, the greater the variable cost.\n◦ Total cost = fixed cost + variable cost.\nThe nature of production\n◦ Two assumptions:\n1.

Demand curve\nDemand the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able \nto purchase at each price. \nDemand for each good and services can be obtained by individual consumer’s \npreference and their budgets.\nDemand represent the amount of wiliness to pay of the society. \n1. Demand curve\nThe total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity \ndemanded. \nSo, In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. \nDemand is mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities \ndemanded at those prices.\n1. Demand curve\nP         Q\nP         Q \nEconomists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity \ndemanded the law of demand. \nThe law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand are \nheld constant.\n1. Demand curve\nQ\nP\n1. Demand curve\nDemand curves can somewhat different for each product. \nThey may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. \nNearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope \ndown from left to right. \n2. Supply curve\nQuantity supplied means the amount of some good or service a producer is \nwilling to supply at each price. \nPrice is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. \nA rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of \nthat good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied.\n2. Supply curve\nQ\nP\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n18000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nWhat will be happened in next?\nSome chicken houses can not sell their chickens. So, Raw chickens, oils, flours \nat their storages starts to go bad.\nSome chicken houses will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a \nlower price than not to sell at all. \nSo, if the price is above the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to fall toward the equilibrium.\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n12000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nConsumers always are waiting their order and chicken houses says that they \nare filled with orders and there are no more stock of raw meats.\nIt’s not difficult for chicken houses to realize that even if they raise the price, \nthey can sell their stock out.\nSo, if the price is below the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to rise toward the equilibrium.\n4. Equilibrium\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nQ* = 1000\nP*\n=15000\nE\nE’\n4. Equilibrium\nThe word “equilibrium” means “balance.” \nIf a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason to \nmove away from that point. \nHowever, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise to \nmove the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.\n4. Equilibrium\nIn 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether \nsupply or demand determined a price was like arguing\n“whether it is the upper or the \nunder blade of a pair of \nscissors that cuts a piece of \npaper.” \n\n5. Shift of demand curve\nPrice, however, is not the only thing that influences demand and supply.\nWhat if overall consumer’s income has changed? \nSometime preferences can be suddenly changed.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \n5. Shift of demand curve\nQ\nP\nD0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nD1\nD2\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDoes the higher income always bring greater demand?\nA product whose demand rises when income rises is called a normal good.\nbut, there is a few exceptions to this pattern do exist. \nA product whose demand falls when income rises is called an inferior good. \n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnd, for some goods such as luxury cars, fine cuisines, or jewelry, the effect of \na rise in income can be especially pronounced.\nWe called those luxury goods.\nA luxury good is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally \nas income rises, \n5. Shift of demand curve\nOf course, income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand.\nWe can think about some of other factors that shift demand curves.\nOne of those is changing tastes or preferences.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \nIt might cause a severe avoiding to eat chickens.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDemographic changes can also be a important factor.\nActually, the demographic changes is combined with the changes in preference.\nSince the consumption preference of youth and old person is quite different, \nchanges in the demographic structure directly affects the overall preference of \nthe society.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnother example is the housing demand.\nSince the demand for owning houses is usually peaked in the middle age about \n40s, the overall housing demand can also be peaked, when the number of \nmiddle-aged in the country is the highest level.\nSome economists have tried to predict the future housing prices by using \npredictable demographic changes.\nMankiw, N. G., & Weil, D. N. (1989). The baby boom, the baby bust, and the \nhousing market. Regional science and urban economics, 19(2), 235-258.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nIt is also true that expectations about the future price (or expectations about \ntastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand.\nFor example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the \nstore to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. \nThese changes can push the demand curve to the right.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nOne interest thing is that some goods can be seriously affected by the \nexpectation.\nFor example, we can think about housing market.\nDemand for housing is not only determined  by preferences, but also by the \nexpectations for capital gain.\nThis feature of housing markets sometimes causes speculations in housing \nmarkets.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nHow about the supply curves? \nOne of most important factor affecting the supply curve might be the \nproduction cost.\nIf a firm faces lower costs of production, a firm’s profits go up. This can be \nshown by the supply curve shifting to the right.\nif a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any \ngiven selling price for its products. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the \nleft.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nQ\nP\nS0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nS1 S2\n6. Shift of supply curve\nSeveral other things affect the cost of production, too. \nWe can think about new technologies for production, and some government \npolicies.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nWhen producers develops or discovers a technology that allows the firm to \nproduce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right, as well. \nThink about the cost of raising a chicken in chicken farm and the poultry \nfactory system.\n\n6. Shift of supply curve\nGovernment policies also can affect the cost of production and the supply \ncurve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies.\nA subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces the \nfirm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. \nFrom the firm’s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of \nproduction that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower \nquantity at every given price. \nSo, government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at \nevery given price, shifting supply to the right.\n7. Price controls\nIn some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on politicians\n\n7. Price controls\nLaws that government enacts to regulate prices are called Price controls.\nPrice controls come in two ways.\nA price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level.\nAnd, a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n18000\n15000 E0\nE1\n1200\n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE2\n1500\n7. Price controls\nA price floor is the lowest legal price that can be paid in the market.\nPrice floors are sometimes called price supports. \nBecause they support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE’\n1500\nE\n7. Price controls\nThe demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the \nincentives provided by these laws to control prices.\nAs a result, It will often lead to undesirable consequences. \nIt implies alternative policy tools can often achieve the desired goals of price \ncontrol laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs."

Maximization of the objective under the constraint (rationality)\n2. Maximization of the utility subject to the budget constraint\n•  Marginal analysis\n3.  Derivation of a demand curve\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Suppose there is a consumer whose name is Pepe. He is the representative agent of all customers in our \nsociety.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• We want to capture that consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and \nwant.\n• Pepe has 5,600 wons in spending money each week.\n• He can allocate this spending between meal ticket and shirts. \n• The meal tickets cost 700 wons each, and the shirts are 1,400 wons each.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Of course, the budget constraint diagram containing just two goods is not realistic. \n• Because, in a modern economy, people choose from thousands of goods.\n• However, thinking about a model with many goods can be just a straightforward extension of what we \ndiscussed here.\n• The point is that there is always a trade-off problem in decisions.\n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket\n8\n4\n• Each point on the line of \nbudget constraint \nrepresents a combination \nof meal tickets and shirts, \nwhich the total cost adds \nup to Pepe’s budget of \n5,600 won. \nClothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• If he spend out his budget, we can \nthink his budget constraint is actually \nthe outer line of the colored area.\n• If he had unlimited income or goods \nwere free, then he could consume \nwithout limit.  \n• Any point outside the constraint is \nnot affordable, because it would cost \nmore money than Pepe has in his \nbudget.\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• It just means that,\n𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒.\n• In this case,\n• Income = 5,600 wons\n• Expenditure = 700 M + 1,400 S\n• So, 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• To draw it in a 2-D plane,\n➢5600 = 700M + 1400S\n➢700M = 5600 – 1400S\n➢M = 8 – 2S\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• The slope of the budget constraint is \ndetermined by the relative price. \n• Relative price - How many meal \ntickets would Pepe have to give up to \nget one more shirt, while staying \nwithin his budget?\n• All along the budget set, getting 1 \nshirt means giving up 2 meal tickets.\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Economists call it opportunity cost.\n• Opportunity cost indicate what have to be given up to obtain something. In other words, opportunity cost \nis the value of the next best alternative.\n• For Pepe, the opportunity cost of 1 shirt is the 2 meal tickets. \n• He would decide to buy one more shirt, If the value of the extra shirt exceed the value of the alternative \n(2 meal tickets).\n1. Budget Constraint\n• A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost.\n• If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost might be the time which would be spent \nto make up the class.\n• If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. \n• In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price.\n• For example, attending graduate school is the case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. \nThe explicit costs of attending college might be about tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. \nBut in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a \npaying job. Thus, graduate school imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost \nearnings.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if the price of a good changes?\n• Suppose that, the price of bus ticket increased to 1,400 won.\n• A price increase for bus tickets would have no effect on the ability to purchase Ramen. \n• But it would reduce the number of bus tickets which Pepe could afford to buy.\n• What happens in the budget constraint? Redraw it. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if Pepe’s income changes?\n• Suppose that, his income drops as a half(=2,800 won).\n• In this case, it would reduce the number of both of meal tickets and shirts which Pepe could afford to buy. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n4\n2\n1. Budget Constraint\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n2. Utility\n• People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility from using those goods and services.\n• Utility is the term which economists use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction/usefulness or \nhappiness with his or her choices.\n• Of course, in our daily life, we don’t measure such a thing. But, in model, it can be a quite useful \ninstrument to replicate the underlying incentive structure of each individuals.\n2. Utility\nEconomists assume the feature of utility\n1.The more of some good one consumes, the more utility \none obtains.\n2. As a person consumes more of a good, the additional (or \nmarginal) utility from each additional unit of the good \ndeclines.\n2. Utility\n• It is a general pattern that consumption of the first few units of good tends to bring a higher level of \nutility than consumption of later units.\n• Suppose that you are in thirsty. You can compare the degree to which the first few drops of water relieve \nthe thirst and the extent to which the drinking water later resolves the thirst.\n• Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility.\n• It means that, the utility of a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more \nthan the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.\n2. Utility\n• The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing \nchoices. \n• Most of people would not say, “My favorite food is potato, so I will eat nothing but only potatoes from \nnow on.”\n• Even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the marginal \nutility from those last few servings would not be very high. \n2. Utility\n• An example for the marginal utilities for meal ticket (and shirt):\n𝑀𝑈𝑀 = 1\n𝑀\n𝑀𝑈𝑆 = 1\n𝑆\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n• The marginal approach is based on looking at the tradeoffs(measured in terms of marginal utility per \nspending) of consuming less of one good and more of another.\n• Marginal utility of X = additional utility from consuming 1 more unit (the smallest unit we can imagine) \nof X\n• Which decision is better? Check the marginal utilities.\n• But we have to consider that the prices are different.\n• Relative price indicates how much unit of Y can be exchanged with 1 more X.\n• Marginal utility per spending of X = marginal utility of X / price of X\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 1\n• Which decision is better? Comparing the marginal utilities per spending.\n• Suppose an initial state of X,Y . What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ? Can he/she better off (by changing in decision for \nX,Y)? Yes. Suppose that he/she get more X by giving up some Y .\n• What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ?\n• After all adjustments, we derive the rule of maximization \n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\n• Note that there is no incentive to deviate from the equality condition.\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 2\n• Suppose that he/she starts to spend money from 0.\n• To make the best decision, he/she would choose the plan with a higher marginal utility per spending. For \nexample, if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n, he/she will choose X.\n• Note that the marginal utility of one good decreases as he/she consume more. If he/she consume X more \nand more, \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n. In that case, he/she can get more utility by getting more Y and giving up some X.\n• That means, if he/she is rational, he/she will stick to the condition,\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\nMarginal analysis\n: The rule of maximization\n• If there are other goods (which means, in more general terms),\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n= ⋯ =\n𝑴𝑼𝒁\n𝑷𝒁\n.\n• The rule of maximization captures several important characteristics of consumers in market economy.\n• The relationship among consumptions on different items.\n• The effect of price change\n• The effect of income change\n• How the shape of marginal utilities affect consumption plan (and how the consumption plan responses to income/price change)?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Budget constraint : 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nUtility function : 𝑀𝑈𝑀 = \n1\n𝑀, 𝑀𝑈𝑆 = \n1\n𝑆\n• What is the optimal choice for M, S?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Now, let’s suppose that the income goes up to 11,200 won.\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nIncome effect\n• Income effect and the characteristics of good\n• Normal goods : an increase in income causes an increase in demand (+)\n• Inferior goods : an increase in income causes a decrease in demand (-)\n• Luxury goods : an increase in income causes a bigger percentage increase in demand (++)\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• What if the price of M goes to 1400 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• If the price of S falls to 700 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 8 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n8\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• When a price changes,\n• Substitution effect : change in relative price (the slope in budget constraint)\n• Income effect (of a price change) : shift in real purchasing power\nPrice effect\n• Price effect : an increase in price causes an decrease in demand (-)\n* Special case : Giffen goods – price effect (+)\n• Relationship between goods\n• Substitute goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\n• Complementary goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• Then, consider price effect on other good\n• On substitute goods : an increase in the price of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• On complementary goods : an increase in the price of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\nDemand curve\n• What is demand curve?

In the short run, we can classify the \ncosts into fixed costs and variable costs.\n◦ Fixed costs are the costs that cannot be changed in the short run.\n◦ Variable costs are the costs that can be changed.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of \nproduction, at least not in the short term.\n◦ For example, the cost of building factory or buying heavy equipment, research and \ndevelopment costs, advertising expenses. \n◦ The level of fixed costs varies according to the feature of the products or \nindustry. \n◦ For instance, manufacturing mobile phone or computer chips requires an \nexpensive factory. But, a food-truck or a painting artist can get by with \nrelatively less fixed costs.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Variable costs are incurred in the act of producing.\n◦ For example, wages and cost to buy intermediate goods are variable costs.\n◦ The more you produce, the greater the variable cost.\n◦ Total cost = fixed cost + variable cost.\nThe nature of production\n◦ Two assumptions:\n1.

Introduction\nIn this week, we will learn about:\n- Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for \nGoods and Services\n-   Shifts in Demand and Supply curves\n- Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity\n- Price Ceilings and Price Floors\nMarket Equilibrium\nFirm\n1\nFirm\n2\nFirm\n3\nFirm\n4\nFirm\n5\nGood & \nservice \nmarket\nProduction \nfactor \nmarket\n1. Demand curve\nDemand the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able \nto purchase at each price. \nDemand for each good and services can be obtained by individual consumer’s \npreference and their budgets.\nDemand represent the amount of wiliness to pay of the society. \n1. Demand curve\nThe total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity \ndemanded. \nSo, In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. \nDemand is mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities \ndemanded at those prices.\n1. Demand curve\nP         Q\nP         Q \nEconomists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity \ndemanded the law of demand. \nThe law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand are \nheld constant.\n1. Demand curve\nQ\nP\n1. Demand curve\nDemand curves can somewhat different for each product. \nThey may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. \nNearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope \ndown from left to right. \n2. Supply curve\nQuantity supplied means the amount of some good or service a producer is \nwilling to supply at each price. \nPrice is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. \nA rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of \nthat good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied.\n2. Supply curve\nQ\nP\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n18000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nWhat will be happened in next?\nSome chicken houses can not sell their chickens. So, Raw chickens, oils, flours \nat their storages starts to go bad.\nSome chicken houses will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a \nlower price than not to sell at all. \nSo, if the price is above the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to fall toward the equilibrium.\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n12000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nConsumers always are waiting their order and chicken houses says that they \nare filled with orders and there are no more stock of raw meats.\nIt’s not difficult for chicken houses to realize that even if they raise the price, \nthey can sell their stock out.\nSo, if the price is below the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to rise toward the equilibrium.\n4. Equilibrium\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nQ* = 1000\nP*\n=15000\nE\nE’\n4. Equilibrium\nThe word “equilibrium” means “balance.” \nIf a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason to \nmove away from that point. \nHowever, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise to \nmove the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.\n4. Equilibrium\nIn 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether \nsupply or demand determined a price was like arguing\n“whether it is the upper or the \nunder blade of a pair of \nscissors that cuts a piece of \npaper.” \n5. Shift of demand curve\nPrice, however, is not the only thing that influences demand and supply.\nWhat if overall consumer’s income has changed? \nSometime preferences can be suddenly changed.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \n5. Shift of demand curve\nQ\nP\nD0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nD1\nD2\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDoes the higher income always bring greater demand?\nA product whose demand rises when income rises is called a normal good.\nbut, there is a few exceptions to this pattern do exist. \nA product whose demand falls when income rises is called an inferior good. \n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnd, for some goods such as luxury cars, fine cuisines, or jewelry, the effect of \na rise in income can be especially pronounced.\nWe called those luxury goods.\nA luxury good is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally \nas income rises, \n5. Shift of demand curve\nOf course, income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand.\nWe can think about some of other factors that shift demand curves.\nOne of those is changing tastes or preferences.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \nIt might cause a severe avoiding to eat chickens.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDemographic changes can also be a important factor.\nActually, the demographic changes is combined with the changes in preference.\nSince the consumption preference of youth and old person is quite different, \nchanges in the demographic structure directly affects the overall preference of \nthe society.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnother example is the housing demand.\nSince the demand for owning houses is usually peaked in the middle age about \n40s, the overall housing demand can also be peaked, when the number of \nmiddle-aged in the country is the highest level.\nSome economists have tried to predict the future housing prices by using \npredictable demographic changes.\nMankiw, N. G., & Weil, D. N. (1989). The baby boom, the baby bust, and the \nhousing market. Regional science and urban economics, 19(2), 235-258.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nIt is also true that expectations about the future price (or expectations about \ntastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand.\nFor example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the \nstore to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. \nThese changes can push the demand curve to the right.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nOne interest thing is that some goods can be seriously affected by the \nexpectation.\nFor example, we can think about housing market.\nDemand for housing is not only determined  by preferences, but also by the \nexpectations for capital gain.\nThis feature of housing markets sometimes causes speculations in housing \nmarkets.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nHow about the supply curves? \nOne of most important factor affecting the supply curve might be the \nproduction cost.\nIf a firm faces lower costs of production, a firm’s profits go up. This can be \nshown by the supply curve shifting to the right.\nif a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any \ngiven selling price for its products. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the \nleft.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nQ\nP\nS0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nS1 S2\n6. Shift of supply curve\nSeveral other things affect the cost of production, too. \nWe can think about new technologies for production, and some government \npolicies.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nWhen producers develops or discovers a technology that allows the firm to \nproduce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right, as well. \nThink about the cost of raising a chicken in chicken farm and the poultry \nfactory system.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nGovernment policies also can affect the cost of production and the supply \ncurve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies.\nA subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces the \nfirm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. \nFrom the firm’s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of \nproduction that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower \nquantity at every given price. \nSo, government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at \nevery given price, shifting supply to the right.\n7. Price controls\nIn some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on politicians\n7. Price controls\nLaws that government enacts to regulate prices are called Price controls.\nPrice controls come in two ways.\nA price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level.\nAnd, a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n18000\n15000 E0\nE1\n1200\n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE2\n1500\n7. Price controls\nA price floor is the lowest legal price that can be paid in the market.\nPrice floors are sometimes called price supports. \nBecause they support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE’\n1500\nE\n7. Price controls\nThe demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the \nincentives provided by these laws to control prices.\nAs a result, It will often lead to undesirable consequences. \nIt implies alternative policy tools can often achieve the desired goals of price \ncontrol laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs."

Budget Constraint\n• We want to capture that consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and \nwant.\n• Pepe has 5,600 wons in spending money each week.\n• He can allocate this spending between meal ticket and shirts. \n• The meal tickets cost 700 wons each, and the shirts are 1,400 wons each.\n\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Of course, the budget constraint diagram containing just two goods is not realistic. \n• Because, in a modern economy, people choose from thousands of goods.\n• However, thinking about a model with many goods can be just a straightforward extension of what we \ndiscussed here.\n• The point is that there is always a trade-off problem in decisions.\n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket\n8\n4\n• Each point on the line of \nbudget constraint \nrepresents a combination \nof meal tickets and shirts, \nwhich the total cost adds \nup to Pepe’s budget of \n5,600 won. \nClothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• If he spend out his budget, we can \nthink his budget constraint is actually \nthe outer line of the colored area.\n• If he had unlimited income or goods \nwere free, then he could consume \nwithout limit.  \n• Any point outside the constraint is \nnot affordable, because it would cost \nmore money than Pepe has in his \nbudget.\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• It just means that,\n𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒.\n• In this case,\n• Income = 5,600 wons\n• Expenditure = 700 M + 1,400 S\n• So, 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• To draw it in a 2-D plane,\n➢5600 = 700M + 1400S\n➢700M = 5600 – 1400S\n➢M = 8 – 2S\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• The slope of the budget constraint is \ndetermined by the relative price. \n• Relative price - How many meal \ntickets would Pepe have to give up to \nget one more shirt, while staying \nwithin his budget?\n• All along the budget set, getting 1 \nshirt means giving up 2 meal tickets.\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Economists call it opportunity cost.\n• Opportunity cost indicate what have to be given up to obtain something. In other words, opportunity cost \nis the value of the next best alternative.\n• For Pepe, the opportunity cost of 1 shirt is the 2 meal tickets. \n• He would decide to buy one more shirt, If the value of the extra shirt exceed the value of the alternative \n(2 meal tickets).\n1. Budget Constraint\n• A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost.\n• If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost might be the time which would be spent \nto make up the class.\n• If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. \n• In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price.\n• For example, attending graduate school is the case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. \nThe explicit costs of attending college might be about tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. \nBut in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a \npaying job. Thus, graduate school imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost \nearnings.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if the price of a good changes?\n• Suppose that, the price of bus ticket increased to 1,400 won.\n• A price increase for bus tickets would have no effect on the ability to purchase Ramen. \n• But it would reduce the number of bus tickets which Pepe could afford to buy.\n• What happens in the budget constraint? Redraw it. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if Pepe’s income changes?\n• Suppose that, his income drops as a half(=2,800 won).\n• In this case, it would reduce the number of both of meal tickets and shirts which Pepe could afford to buy. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n4\n2\n1. Budget Constraint\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n2. Utility\n• People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility from using those goods and services.\n• Utility is the term which economists use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction/usefulness or \nhappiness with his or her choices.\n• Of course, in our daily life, we don’t measure such a thing. But, in model, it can be a quite useful \ninstrument to replicate the underlying incentive structure of each individuals.\n2. Utility\nEconomists assume the feature of utility\n1.The more of some good one consumes, the more utility \none obtains.\n2. As a person consumes more of a good, the additional (or \nmarginal) utility from each additional unit of the good \ndeclines.\n2. Utility\n• It is a general pattern that consumption of the first few units of good tends to bring a higher level of \nutility than consumption of later units.\n• Suppose that you are in thirsty. You can compare the degree to which the first few drops of water relieve \nthe thirst and the extent to which the drinking water later resolves the thirst.\n• Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility.\n• It means that, the utility of a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more \nthan the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.\n2. Utility\n• The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing \nchoices. \n• Most of people would not say, “My favorite food is potato, so I will eat nothing but only potatoes from \nnow on.”\n• Even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the marginal \nutility from those last few servings would not be very high. \n2. Utility\n• An example for the marginal utilities for meal ticket (and shirt):\n𝑀𝑈𝑀 = 1\n𝑀\n𝑀𝑈𝑆 = 1\n𝑆\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n• The marginal approach is based on looking at the tradeoffs(measured in terms of marginal utility per \nspending) of consuming less of one good and more of another.\n• Marginal utility of X = additional utility from consuming 1 more unit (the smallest unit we can imagine) \nof X\n• Which decision is better? Check the marginal utilities.\n• But we have to consider that the prices are different.\n• Relative price indicates how much unit of Y can be exchanged with 1 more X.\n• Marginal utility per spending of X = marginal utility of X / price of X\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 1\n• Which decision is better? Comparing the marginal utilities per spending.\n• Suppose an initial state of X,Y . What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n>\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ? Can he/she better off (by changing in decision for \nX,Y)? Yes. Suppose that he/she get more X by giving up some Y . \n• What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n<\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ?\n• After all adjustments, we derive the rule of maximization \n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\n• Note that there is no incentive to deviate from the equality condition.\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 2\n• Suppose that he/she starts to spend money from 0.\n• To make the best decision, he/she would choose the plan with a higher marginal utility per spending. For \nexample, if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n>\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n, he/she will choose X.\n• Note that the marginal utility of one good decreases as he/she consume more. If he/she consume X more \nand more, \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n<\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n. In that case, he/she can get more utility by getting more Y and giving up some X.\n• That means, if he/she is rational, he/she will stick to the condition,\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\nMarginal analysis\n: The rule of maximization\n• If there are other goods (which means, in more general terms),\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n= ⋯ =\n𝑴𝑼𝒁\n𝑷𝒁\n.\n• The rule of maximization captures several important characteristics of consumers in market economy.\n• The relationship among consumptions on different items.\n• The effect of price change\n• The effect of income change\n• How the shape of marginal utilities affect consumption plan (and how the consumption plan responses to income/price change)?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Budget constraint : 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nUtility function : 𝑀𝑈𝑀 =\n1\n𝑀, 𝑀𝑈𝑆 =\n1\n𝑆\n• What is the optimal choice for M, S?\n\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Now, let’s suppose that the income goes up to 11,200 won.\n\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nIncome effect\n• Income effect and the characteristics of good\n• Normal goods : an increase in income causes an increase in demand (+)\n• Inferior goods : an increase in income causes a decrease in demand (-)\n• Luxury goods : an increase in income causes a bigger percentage increase in demand (++)\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• What if the price of M goes to 1400 won ?\n\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• If the price of S falls to 700 won ?\n\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 8 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n8\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• When a price changes,\n• Substitution effect : change in relative price (the slope in budget constraint)\n• Income effect (of a price change) : shift in real purchasing power\n\nPrice effect\n• Price effect : an increase in price causes an decrease in demand (-)\n* Special case : Giffen goods – price effect (+)\n• Relationship between goods\n• Substitute goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\n• Complementary goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• Then, consider price effect on other good\n• On substitute goods : an increase in the price of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• On complementary goods : an increase in the price of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\nDemand curve\n• What is demand curve? The relationship between price and quantity demanded\n• What is the quantity demanded? We know what occurs if consumers follow their self-interest. => The \noptimal decision of consumption\n• Remind that price effect is negative (-).\nThanks!!"

In the short run, we can classify the \ncosts into fixed costs and variable costs.\n◦ Fixed costs are the costs that cannot be changed in the short run.\n◦ Variable costs are the costs that can be changed.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of \nproduction, at least not in the short term.\n◦ For example, the cost of building factory or buying heavy equipment, research and \ndevelopment costs, advertising expenses. \n◦ The level of fixed costs varies according to the feature of the products or \nindustry. \n◦ For instance, manufacturing mobile phone or computer chips requires an \nexpensive factory. But, a food-truck or a painting artist can get by with \nrelatively less fixed costs.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Variable costs are incurred in the act of producing.\n◦ For example, wages and cost to buy intermediate goods are variable costs.\n◦ The more you produce, the greater the variable cost.\n◦ Total cost = fixed cost + variable cost.\nThe nature of production\n◦ Two assumptions:\n1.

Demand curve\nDemand the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able \nto purchase at each price. \nDemand for each good and services can be obtained by individual consumer’s \npreference and their budgets.\nDemand represent the amount of wiliness to pay of the society. \n1. Demand curve\nThe total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity \ndemanded. \nSo, In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. \nDemand is mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities \ndemanded at those prices.\n1. Demand curve\nP         Q\nP         Q \nEconomists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity \ndemanded the law of demand. \nThe law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand are \nheld constant.\n1. Demand curve\nQ\nP\n1. Demand curve\nDemand curves can somewhat different for each product. \nThey may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. \nNearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope \ndown from left to right. \n2. Supply curve\nQuantity supplied means the amount of some good or service a producer is \nwilling to supply at each price. \nPrice is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. \nA rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of \nthat good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied.\n2. Supply curve\nQ\nP\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n18000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nWhat will be happened in next?\nSome chicken houses can not sell their chickens. So, Raw chickens, oils, flours \nat their storages starts to go bad.\nSome chicken houses will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a \nlower price than not to sell at all. \nSo, if the price is above the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to fall toward the equilibrium.\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n12000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nConsumers always are waiting their order and chicken houses says that they \nare filled with orders and there are no more stock of raw meats.\nIt’s not difficult for chicken houses to realize that even if they raise the price, \nthey can sell their stock out.\nSo, if the price is below the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to rise toward the equilibrium.\n4. Equilibrium\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nQ* = 1000\nP*\n=15000\nE\nE’\n4. Equilibrium\nThe word “equilibrium” means “balance.” \nIf a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason to \nmove away from that point. \nHowever, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise to \nmove the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.\n4. Equilibrium\nIn 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether \nsupply or demand determined a price was like arguing\n“whether it is the upper or the \nunder blade of a pair of \nscissors that cuts a piece of \npaper.” \n\n5. Shift of demand curve\nPrice, however, is not the only thing that influences demand and supply.\nWhat if overall consumer’s income has changed? \nSometime preferences can be suddenly changed.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \n5. Shift of demand curve\nQ\nP\nD0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nD1\nD2\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDoes the higher income always bring greater demand?\nA product whose demand rises when income rises is called a normal good.\nbut, there is a few exceptions to this pattern do exist. \nA product whose demand falls when income rises is called an inferior good. \n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnd, for some goods such as luxury cars, fine cuisines, or jewelry, the effect of \na rise in income can be especially pronounced.\nWe called those luxury goods.\nA luxury good is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally \nas income rises, \n5. Shift of demand curve\nOf course, income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand.\nWe can think about some of other factors that shift demand curves.\nOne of those is changing tastes or preferences.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \nIt might cause a severe avoiding to eat chickens.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDemographic changes can also be a important factor.\nActually, the demographic changes is combined with the changes in preference.\nSince the consumption preference of youth and old person is quite different, \nchanges in the demographic structure directly affects the overall preference of \nthe society.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnother example is the housing demand.\nSince the demand for owning houses is usually peaked in the middle age about \n40s, the overall housing demand can also be peaked, when the number of \nmiddle-aged in the country is the highest level.\nSome economists have tried to predict the future housing prices by using \npredictable demographic changes.\nMankiw, N. G., & Weil, D. N. (1989). The baby boom, the baby bust, and the \nhousing market. Regional science and urban economics, 19(2), 235-258.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nIt is also true that expectations about the future price (or expectations about \ntastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand.\nFor example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the \nstore to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. \nThese changes can push the demand curve to the right.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nOne interest thing is that some goods can be seriously affected by the \nexpectation.\nFor example, we can think about housing market.\nDemand for housing is not only determined  by preferences, but also by the \nexpectations for capital gain.\nThis feature of housing markets sometimes causes speculations in housing \nmarkets.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nHow about the supply curves? \nOne of most important factor affecting the supply curve might be the \nproduction cost.\nIf a firm faces lower costs of production, a firm’s profits go up. This can be \nshown by the supply curve shifting to the right.\nif a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any \ngiven selling price for its products. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the \nleft.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nQ\nP\nS0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nS1 S2\n6. Shift of supply curve\nSeveral other things affect the cost of production, too. \nWe can think about new technologies for production, and some government \npolicies.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nWhen producers develops or discovers a technology that allows the firm to \nproduce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right, as well. \nThink about the cost of raising a chicken in chicken farm and the poultry \nfactory system.\n\n6. Shift of supply curve\nGovernment policies also can affect the cost of production and the supply \ncurve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies.\nA subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces the \nfirm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. \nFrom the firm’s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of \nproduction that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower \nquantity at every given price. \nSo, government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at \nevery given price, shifting supply to the right.\n7. Price controls\nIn some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on politicians\n\n7. Price controls\nLaws that government enacts to regulate prices are called Price controls.\nPrice controls come in two ways.\nA price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level.\nAnd, a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n18000\n15000 E0\nE1\n1200\n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE2\n1500\n7. Price controls\nA price floor is the lowest legal price that can be paid in the market.\nPrice floors are sometimes called price supports. \nBecause they support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE’\n1500\nE\n7. Price controls\nThe demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the \nincentives provided by these laws to control prices.\nAs a result, It will often lead to undesirable consequences. \nIt implies alternative policy tools can often achieve the desired goals of price \ncontrol laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs."

Maximization of the objective under the constraint (rationality)\n2. Maximization of the utility subject to the budget constraint\n•  Marginal analysis\n3.  Derivation of a demand curve\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Suppose there is a consumer whose name is Pepe. He is the representative agent of all customers in our \nsociety.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• We want to capture that consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and \nwant.\n• Pepe has 5,600 wons in spending money each week.\n• He can allocate this spending between meal ticket and shirts. \n• The meal tickets cost 700 wons each, and the shirts are 1,400 wons each.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Of course, the budget constraint diagram containing just two goods is not realistic. \n• Because, in a modern economy, people choose from thousands of goods.\n• However, thinking about a model with many goods can be just a straightforward extension of what we \ndiscussed here.\n• The point is that there is always a trade-off problem in decisions.\n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket\n8\n4\n• Each point on the line of \nbudget constraint \nrepresents a combination \nof meal tickets and shirts, \nwhich the total cost adds \nup to Pepe’s budget of \n5,600 won. \nClothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• If he spend out his budget, we can \nthink his budget constraint is actually \nthe outer line of the colored area.\n• If he had unlimited income or goods \nwere free, then he could consume \nwithout limit.  \n• Any point outside the constraint is \nnot affordable, because it would cost \nmore money than Pepe has in his \nbudget.\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• It just means that,\n𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒.\n• In this case,\n• Income = 5,600 wons\n• Expenditure = 700 M + 1,400 S\n• So, 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• To draw it in a 2-D plane,\n➢5600 = 700M + 1400S\n➢700M = 5600 – 1400S\n➢M = 8 – 2S\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• The slope of the budget constraint is \ndetermined by the relative price. \n• Relative price - How many meal \ntickets would Pepe have to give up to \nget one more shirt, while staying \nwithin his budget?\n• All along the budget set, getting 1 \nshirt means giving up 2 meal tickets.\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Economists call it opportunity cost.\n• Opportunity cost indicate what have to be given up to obtain something. In other words, opportunity cost \nis the value of the next best alternative.\n• For Pepe, the opportunity cost of 1 shirt is the 2 meal tickets. \n• He would decide to buy one more shirt, If the value of the extra shirt exceed the value of the alternative \n(2 meal tickets).\n1. Budget Constraint\n• A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost.\n• If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost might be the time which would be spent \nto make up the class.\n• If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. \n• In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price.\n• For example, attending graduate school is the case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. \nThe explicit costs of attending college might be about tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. \nBut in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a \npaying job. Thus, graduate school imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost \nearnings.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if the price of a good changes?\n• Suppose that, the price of bus ticket increased to 1,400 won.\n• A price increase for bus tickets would have no effect on the ability to purchase Ramen. \n• But it would reduce the number of bus tickets which Pepe could afford to buy.\n• What happens in the budget constraint? Redraw it. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if Pepe’s income changes?\n• Suppose that, his income drops as a half(=2,800 won).\n• In this case, it would reduce the number of both of meal tickets and shirts which Pepe could afford to buy. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n4\n2\n1. Budget Constraint\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n2. Utility\n• People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility from using those goods and services.\n• Utility is the term which economists use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction/usefulness or \nhappiness with his or her choices.\n• Of course, in our daily life, we don’t measure such a thing. But, in model, it can be a quite useful \ninstrument to replicate the underlying incentive structure of each individuals.\n2. Utility\nEconomists assume the feature of utility\n1.The more of some good one consumes, the more utility \none obtains.\n2. As a person consumes more of a good, the additional (or \nmarginal) utility from each additional unit of the good \ndeclines.\n2. Utility\n• It is a general pattern that consumption of the first few units of good tends to bring a higher level of \nutility than consumption of later units.\n• Suppose that you are in thirsty. You can compare the degree to which the first few drops of water relieve \nthe thirst and the extent to which the drinking water later resolves the thirst.\n• Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility.\n• It means that, the utility of a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more \nthan the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.\n2. Utility\n• The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing \nchoices. \n• Most of people would not say, “My favorite food is potato, so I will eat nothing but only potatoes from \nnow on.”\n• Even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the marginal \nutility from those last few servings would not be very high. \n2. Utility\n• An example for the marginal utilities for meal ticket (and shirt):\n𝑀𝑈𝑀 = 1\n𝑀\n𝑀𝑈𝑆 = 1\n𝑆\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n• The marginal approach is based on looking at the tradeoffs(measured in terms of marginal utility per \nspending) of consuming less of one good and more of another.\n• Marginal utility of X = additional utility from consuming 1 more unit (the smallest unit we can imagine) \nof X\n• Which decision is better? Check the marginal utilities.\n• But we have to consider that the prices are different.\n• Relative price indicates how much unit of Y can be exchanged with 1 more X.\n• Marginal utility per spending of X = marginal utility of X / price of X\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 1\n• Which decision is better? Comparing the marginal utilities per spending.\n• Suppose an initial state of X,Y . What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ? Can he/she better off (by changing in decision for \nX,Y)? Yes. Suppose that he/she get more X by giving up some Y .\n• What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ?\n• After all adjustments, we derive the rule of maximization \n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\n• Note that there is no incentive to deviate from the equality condition.\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 2\n• Suppose that he/she starts to spend money from 0.\n• To make the best decision, he/she would choose the plan with a higher marginal utility per spending. For \nexample, if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n, he/she will choose X.\n• Note that the marginal utility of one good decreases as he/she consume more. If he/she consume X more \nand more, \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n. In that case, he/she can get more utility by getting more Y and giving up some X.\n• That means, if he/she is rational, he/she will stick to the condition,\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\nMarginal analysis\n: The rule of maximization\n• If there are other goods (which means, in more general terms),\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n= ⋯ =\n𝑴𝑼𝒁\n𝑷𝒁\n.\n• The rule of maximization captures several important characteristics of consumers in market economy.\n• The relationship among consumptions on different items.\n• The effect of price change\n• The effect of income change\n• How the shape of marginal utilities affect consumption plan (and how the consumption plan responses to income/price change)?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Budget constraint : 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nUtility function : 𝑀𝑈𝑀 = \n1\n𝑀, 𝑀𝑈𝑆 = \n1\n𝑆\n• What is the optimal choice for M, S?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Now, let’s suppose that the income goes up to 11,200 won.\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nIncome effect\n• Income effect and the characteristics of good\n• Normal goods : an increase in income causes an increase in demand (+)\n• Inferior goods : an increase in income causes a decrease in demand (-)\n• Luxury goods : an increase in income causes a bigger percentage increase in demand (++)\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• What if the price of M goes to 1400 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• If the price of S falls to 700 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 8 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n8\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• When a price changes,\n• Substitution effect : change in relative price (the slope in budget constraint)\n• Income effect (of a price change) : shift in real purchasing power\nPrice effect\n• Price effect : an increase in price causes an decrease in demand (-)\n* Special case : Giffen goods – price effect (+)\n• Relationship between goods\n• Substitute goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\n• Complementary goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• Then, consider price effect on other good\n• On substitute goods : an increase in the price of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• On complementary goods : an increase in the price of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\nDemand curve\n• What is demand curve?

In the short run, we can classify the \ncosts into fixed costs and variable costs.\n◦ Fixed costs are the costs that cannot be changed in the short run.\n◦ Variable costs are the costs that can be changed.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of \nproduction, at least not in the short term.\n◦ For example, the cost of building factory or buying heavy equipment, research and \ndevelopment costs, advertising expenses. \n◦ The level of fixed costs varies according to the feature of the products or \nindustry. \n◦ For instance, manufacturing mobile phone or computer chips requires an \nexpensive factory. But, a food-truck or a painting artist can get by with \nrelatively less fixed costs.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Variable costs are incurred in the act of producing.\n◦ For example, wages and cost to buy intermediate goods are variable costs.\n◦ The more you produce, the greater the variable cost.\n◦ Total cost = fixed cost + variable cost.\nThe nature of production\n◦ Two assumptions:\n1.

Introduction\nIn this week, we will learn about:\n- Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for \nGoods and Services\n-   Shifts in Demand and Supply curves\n- Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity\n- Price Ceilings and Price Floors\nMarket Equilibrium\nFirm\n1\nFirm\n2\nFirm\n3\nFirm\n4\nFirm\n5\nGood & \nservice \nmarket\nProduction \nfactor \nmarket\n1. Demand curve\nDemand the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able \nto purchase at each price. \nDemand for each good and services can be obtained by individual consumer’s \npreference and their budgets.\nDemand represent the amount of wiliness to pay of the society. \n1. Demand curve\nThe total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity \ndemanded. \nSo, In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. \nDemand is mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities \ndemanded at those prices.\n1. Demand curve\nP         Q\nP         Q \nEconomists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity \ndemanded the law of demand. \nThe law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand are \nheld constant.\n1. Demand curve\nQ\nP\n1. Demand curve\nDemand curves can somewhat different for each product. \nThey may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. \nNearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope \ndown from left to right. \n2. Supply curve\nQuantity supplied means the amount of some good or service a producer is \nwilling to supply at each price. \nPrice is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. \nA rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of \nthat good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied.\n2. Supply curve\nQ\nP\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n18000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nWhat will be happened in next?\nSome chicken houses can not sell their chickens. So, Raw chickens, oils, flours \nat their storages starts to go bad.\nSome chicken houses will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a \nlower price than not to sell at all. \nSo, if the price is above the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to fall toward the equilibrium.\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n12000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nConsumers always are waiting their order and chicken houses says that they \nare filled with orders and there are no more stock of raw meats.\nIt’s not difficult for chicken houses to realize that even if they raise the price, \nthey can sell their stock out.\nSo, if the price is below the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to rise toward the equilibrium.\n4. Equilibrium\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nQ* = 1000\nP*\n=15000\nE\nE’\n4. Equilibrium\nThe word “equilibrium” means “balance.” \nIf a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason to \nmove away from that point. \nHowever, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise to \nmove the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.\n4. Equilibrium\nIn 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether \nsupply or demand determined a price was like arguing\n“whether it is the upper or the \nunder blade of a pair of \nscissors that cuts a piece of \npaper.” \n5. Shift of demand curve\nPrice, however, is not the only thing that influences demand and supply.\nWhat if overall consumer’s income has changed? \nSometime preferences can be suddenly changed.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \n5. Shift of demand curve\nQ\nP\nD0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nD1\nD2\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDoes the higher income always bring greater demand?\nA product whose demand rises when income rises is called a normal good.\nbut, there is a few exceptions to this pattern do exist. \nA product whose demand falls when income rises is called an inferior good. \n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnd, for some goods such as luxury cars, fine cuisines, or jewelry, the effect of \na rise in income can be especially pronounced.\nWe called those luxury goods.\nA luxury good is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally \nas income rises, \n5. Shift of demand curve\nOf course, income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand.\nWe can think about some of other factors that shift demand curves.\nOne of those is changing tastes or preferences.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \nIt might cause a severe avoiding to eat chickens.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDemographic changes can also be a important factor.\nActually, the demographic changes is combined with the changes in preference.\nSince the consumption preference of youth and old person is quite different, \nchanges in the demographic structure directly affects the overall preference of \nthe society.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnother example is the housing demand.\nSince the demand for owning houses is usually peaked in the middle age about \n40s, the overall housing demand can also be peaked, when the number of \nmiddle-aged in the country is the highest level.\nSome economists have tried to predict the future housing prices by using \npredictable demographic changes.\nMankiw, N. G., & Weil, D. N. (1989). The baby boom, the baby bust, and the \nhousing market. Regional science and urban economics, 19(2), 235-258.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nIt is also true that expectations about the future price (or expectations about \ntastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand.\nFor example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the \nstore to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. \nThese changes can push the demand curve to the right.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nOne interest thing is that some goods can be seriously affected by the \nexpectation.\nFor example, we can think about housing market.\nDemand for housing is not only determined  by preferences, but also by the \nexpectations for capital gain.\nThis feature of housing markets sometimes causes speculations in housing \nmarkets.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nHow about the supply curves? \nOne of most important factor affecting the supply curve might be the \nproduction cost.\nIf a firm faces lower costs of production, a firm’s profits go up. This can be \nshown by the supply curve shifting to the right.\nif a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any \ngiven selling price for its products. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the \nleft.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nQ\nP\nS0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nS1 S2\n6. Shift of supply curve\nSeveral other things affect the cost of production, too. \nWe can think about new technologies for production, and some government \npolicies.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nWhen producers develops or discovers a technology that allows the firm to \nproduce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right, as well. \nThink about the cost of raising a chicken in chicken farm and the poultry \nfactory system.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nGovernment policies also can affect the cost of production and the supply \ncurve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies.\nA subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces the \nfirm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. \nFrom the firm’s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of \nproduction that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower \nquantity at every given price. \nSo, government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at \nevery given price, shifting supply to the right.\n7. Price controls\nIn some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on politicians\n7. Price controls\nLaws that government enacts to regulate prices are called Price controls.\nPrice controls come in two ways.\nA price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level.\nAnd, a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n18000\n15000 E0\nE1\n1200\n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE2\n1500\n7. Price controls\nA price floor is the lowest legal price that can be paid in the market.\nPrice floors are sometimes called price supports. \nBecause they support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE’\n1500\nE\n7. Price controls\nThe demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the \nincentives provided by these laws to control prices.\nAs a result, It will often lead to undesirable consequences. \nIt implies alternative policy tools can often achieve the desired goals of price \ncontrol laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs."

Maximization of the objective under the constraint (rationality)\n2. Maximization of the utility subject to the budget constraint\n•  Marginal analysis\n3.  Derivation of a demand curve\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Suppose there is a consumer whose name is Pepe. He is the representative agent of all customers in our \nsociety.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• We want to capture that consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and \nwant.\n• Pepe has 5,600 wons in spending money each week.\n• He can allocate this spending between meal ticket and shirts. \n• The meal tickets cost 700 wons each, and the shirts are 1,400 wons each.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Of course, the budget constraint diagram containing just two goods is not realistic. \n• Because, in a modern economy, people choose from thousands of goods.\n• However, thinking about a model with many goods can be just a straightforward extension of what we \ndiscussed here.\n• The point is that there is always a trade-off problem in decisions.\n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket\n8\n4\n• Each point on the line of \nbudget constraint \nrepresents a combination \nof meal tickets and shirts, \nwhich the total cost adds \nup to Pepe’s budget of \n5,600 won. \nClothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• If he spend out his budget, we can \nthink his budget constraint is actually \nthe outer line of the colored area.\n• If he had unlimited income or goods \nwere free, then he could consume \nwithout limit.  \n• Any point outside the constraint is \nnot affordable, because it would cost \nmore money than Pepe has in his \nbudget.\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• It just means that,\n𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒.\n• In this case,\n• Income = 5,600 wons\n• Expenditure = 700 M + 1,400 S\n• So, 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• To draw it in a 2-D plane,\n➢5600 = 700M + 1400S\n➢700M = 5600 – 1400S\n➢M = 8 – 2S\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• The slope of the budget constraint is \ndetermined by the relative price. \n• Relative price - How many meal \ntickets would Pepe have to give up to \nget one more shirt, while staying \nwithin his budget?\n• All along the budget set, getting 1 \nshirt means giving up 2 meal tickets.\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Economists call it opportunity cost.\n• Opportunity cost indicate what have to be given up to obtain something. In other words, opportunity cost \nis the value of the next best alternative.\n• For Pepe, the opportunity cost of 1 shirt is the 2 meal tickets. \n• He would decide to buy one more shirt, If the value of the extra shirt exceed the value of the alternative \n(2 meal tickets).\n1. Budget Constraint\n• A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost.\n• If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost might be the time which would be spent \nto make up the class.\n• If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. \n• In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price.\n• For example, attending graduate school is the case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. \nThe explicit costs of attending college might be about tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. \nBut in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a \npaying job. Thus, graduate school imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost \nearnings.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if the price of a good changes?\n• Suppose that, the price of bus ticket increased to 1,400 won.\n• A price increase for bus tickets would have no effect on the ability to purchase Ramen. \n• But it would reduce the number of bus tickets which Pepe could afford to buy.\n• What happens in the budget constraint? Redraw it. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if Pepe’s income changes?\n• Suppose that, his income drops as a half(=2,800 won).\n• In this case, it would reduce the number of both of meal tickets and shirts which Pepe could afford to buy. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n4\n2\n1. Budget Constraint\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n2. Utility\n• People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility from using those goods and services.\n• Utility is the term which economists use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction/usefulness or \nhappiness with his or her choices.\n• Of course, in our daily life, we don’t measure such a thing. But, in model, it can be a quite useful \ninstrument to replicate the underlying incentive structure of each individuals.\n2. Utility\nEconomists assume the feature of utility\n1.The more of some good one consumes, the more utility \none obtains.\n2. As a person consumes more of a good, the additional (or \nmarginal) utility from each additional unit of the good \ndeclines.\n2. Utility\n• It is a general pattern that consumption of the first few units of good tends to bring a higher level of \nutility than consumption of later units.\n• Suppose that you are in thirsty. You can compare the degree to which the first few drops of water relieve \nthe thirst and the extent to which the drinking water later resolves the thirst.\n• Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility.\n• It means that, the utility of a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more \nthan the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.\n2. Utility\n• The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing \nchoices. \n• Most of people would not say, “My favorite food is potato, so I will eat nothing but only potatoes from \nnow on.”\n• Even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the marginal \nutility from those last few servings would not be very high. \n2. Utility\n• An example for the marginal utilities for meal ticket (and shirt):\n𝑀𝑈𝑀 = 1\n𝑀\n𝑀𝑈𝑆 = 1\n𝑆\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n• The marginal approach is based on looking at the tradeoffs(measured in terms of marginal utility per \nspending) of consuming less of one good and more of another.\n• Marginal utility of X = additional utility from consuming 1 more unit (the smallest unit we can imagine) \nof X\n• Which decision is better? Check the marginal utilities.\n• But we have to consider that the prices are different.\n• Relative price indicates how much unit of Y can be exchanged with 1 more X.\n• Marginal utility per spending of X = marginal utility of X / price of X\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 1\n• Which decision is better? Comparing the marginal utilities per spending.\n• Suppose an initial state of X,Y . What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ? Can he/she better off (by changing in decision for \nX,Y)? Yes. Suppose that he/she get more X by giving up some Y .\n• What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ?\n• After all adjustments, we derive the rule of maximization \n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\n• Note that there is no incentive to deviate from the equality condition.\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 2\n• Suppose that he/she starts to spend money from 0.\n• To make the best decision, he/she would choose the plan with a higher marginal utility per spending. For \nexample, if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n, he/she will choose X.\n• Note that the marginal utility of one good decreases as he/she consume more. If he/she consume X more \nand more, \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n. In that case, he/she can get more utility by getting more Y and giving up some X.\n• That means, if he/she is rational, he/she will stick to the condition,\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\nMarginal analysis\n: The rule of maximization\n• If there are other goods (which means, in more general terms),\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n= ⋯ =\n𝑴𝑼𝒁\n𝑷𝒁\n.\n• The rule of maximization captures several important characteristics of consumers in market economy.\n• The relationship among consumptions on different items.\n• The effect of price change\n• The effect of income change\n• How the shape of marginal utilities affect consumption plan (and how the consumption plan responses to income/price change)?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Budget constraint : 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nUtility function : 𝑀𝑈𝑀 = \n1\n𝑀, 𝑀𝑈𝑆 = \n1\n𝑆\n• What is the optimal choice for M, S?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Now, let’s suppose that the income goes up to 11,200 won.\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nIncome effect\n• Income effect and the characteristics of good\n• Normal goods : an increase in income causes an increase in demand (+)\n• Inferior goods : an increase in income causes a decrease in demand (-)\n• Luxury goods : an increase in income causes a bigger percentage increase in demand (++)\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• What if the price of M goes to 1400 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• If the price of S falls to 700 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 8 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n8\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• When a price changes,\n• Substitution effect : change in relative price (the slope in budget constraint)\n• Income effect (of a price change) : shift in real purchasing power\nPrice effect\n• Price effect : an increase in price causes an decrease in demand (-)\n* Special case : Giffen goods – price effect (+)\n• Relationship between goods\n• Substitute goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\n• Complementary goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• Then, consider price effect on other good\n• On substitute goods : an increase in the price of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• On complementary goods : an increase in the price of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\nDemand curve\n• What is demand curve?

In the short run, we can classify the \ncosts into fixed costs and variable costs.\n◦ Fixed costs are the costs that cannot be changed in the short run.\n◦ Variable costs are the costs that can be changed.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of \nproduction, at least not in the short term.\n◦ For example, the cost of building factory or buying heavy equipment, research and \ndevelopment costs, advertising expenses. \n◦ The level of fixed costs varies according to the feature of the products or \nindustry. \n◦ For instance, manufacturing mobile phone or computer chips requires an \nexpensive factory. But, a food-truck or a painting artist can get by with \nrelatively less fixed costs.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Variable costs are incurred in the act of producing.\n◦ For example, wages and cost to buy intermediate goods are variable costs.\n◦ The more you produce, the greater the variable cost.\n◦ Total cost = fixed cost + variable cost.\nThe nature of production\n◦ Two assumptions:\n1.

Introduction\nIn this week, we will learn about:\n- Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for \nGoods and Services\n-   Shifts in Demand and Supply curves\n- Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity\n- Price Ceilings and Price Floors\nMarket Equilibrium\nFirm\n1\nFirm\n2\nFirm\n3\nFirm\n4\nFirm\n5\nGood & \nservice \nmarket\nProduction \nfactor \nmarket\n1. Demand curve\nDemand the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able \nto purchase at each price. \nDemand for each good and services can be obtained by individual consumer’s \npreference and their budgets.\nDemand represent the amount of wiliness to pay of the society. \n1. Demand curve\nThe total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity \ndemanded. \nSo, In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. \nDemand is mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities \ndemanded at those prices.\n1. Demand curve\nP         Q\nP         Q \nEconomists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity \ndemanded the law of demand. \nThe law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand are \nheld constant.\n1. Demand curve\nQ\nP\n1. Demand curve\nDemand curves can somewhat different for each product. \nThey may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. \nNearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope \ndown from left to right. \n2. Supply curve\nQuantity supplied means the amount of some good or service a producer is \nwilling to supply at each price. \nPrice is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. \nA rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of \nthat good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied.\n2. Supply curve\nQ\nP\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n18000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nWhat will be happened in next?\nSome chicken houses can not sell their chickens. So, Raw chickens, oils, flours \nat their storages starts to go bad.\nSome chicken houses will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a \nlower price than not to sell at all. \nSo, if the price is above the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to fall toward the equilibrium.\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n12000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nConsumers always are waiting their order and chicken houses says that they \nare filled with orders and there are no more stock of raw meats.\nIt’s not difficult for chicken houses to realize that even if they raise the price, \nthey can sell their stock out.\nSo, if the price is below the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to rise toward the equilibrium.\n4. Equilibrium\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nQ* = 1000\nP*\n=15000\nE\nE’\n4. Equilibrium\nThe word “equilibrium” means “balance.” \nIf a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason to \nmove away from that point. \nHowever, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise to \nmove the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.\n4. Equilibrium\nIn 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether \nsupply or demand determined a price was like arguing\n“whether it is the upper or the \nunder blade of a pair of \nscissors that cuts a piece of \npaper.” \n5. Shift of demand curve\nPrice, however, is not the only thing that influences demand and supply.\nWhat if overall consumer’s income has changed? \nSometime preferences can be suddenly changed.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \n5. Shift of demand curve\nQ\nP\nD0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nD1\nD2\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDoes the higher income always bring greater demand?\nA product whose demand rises when income rises is called a normal good.\nbut, there is a few exceptions to this pattern do exist. \nA product whose demand falls when income rises is called an inferior good. \n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnd, for some goods such as luxury cars, fine cuisines, or jewelry, the effect of \na rise in income can be especially pronounced.\nWe called those luxury goods.\nA luxury good is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally \nas income rises, \n5. Shift of demand curve\nOf course, income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand.\nWe can think about some of other factors that shift demand curves.\nOne of those is changing tastes or preferences.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \nIt might cause a severe avoiding to eat chickens.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDemographic changes can also be a important factor.\nActually, the demographic changes is combined with the changes in preference.\nSince the consumption preference of youth and old person is quite different, \nchanges in the demographic structure directly affects the overall preference of \nthe society.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnother example is the housing demand.\nSince the demand for owning houses is usually peaked in the middle age about \n40s, the overall housing demand can also be peaked, when the number of \nmiddle-aged in the country is the highest level.\nSome economists have tried to predict the future housing prices by using \npredictable demographic changes.\nMankiw, N. G., & Weil, D. N. (1989). The baby boom, the baby bust, and the \nhousing market. Regional science and urban economics, 19(2), 235-258.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nIt is also true that expectations about the future price (or expectations about \ntastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand.\nFor example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the \nstore to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. \nThese changes can push the demand curve to the right.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nOne interest thing is that some goods can be seriously affected by the \nexpectation.\nFor example, we can think about housing market.\nDemand for housing is not only determined  by preferences, but also by the \nexpectations for capital gain.\nThis feature of housing markets sometimes causes speculations in housing \nmarkets.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nHow about the supply curves? \nOne of most important factor affecting the supply curve might be the \nproduction cost.\nIf a firm faces lower costs of production, a firm’s profits go up. This can be \nshown by the supply curve shifting to the right.\nif a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any \ngiven selling price for its products. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the \nleft.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nQ\nP\nS0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nS1 S2\n6. Shift of supply curve\nSeveral other things affect the cost of production, too. \nWe can think about new technologies for production, and some government \npolicies.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nWhen producers develops or discovers a technology that allows the firm to \nproduce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right, as well. \nThink about the cost of raising a chicken in chicken farm and the poultry \nfactory system.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nGovernment policies also can affect the cost of production and the supply \ncurve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies.\nA subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces the \nfirm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. \nFrom the firm’s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of \nproduction that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower \nquantity at every given price. \nSo, government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at \nevery given price, shifting supply to the right.\n7. Price controls\nIn some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on politicians\n7. Price controls\nLaws that government enacts to regulate prices are called Price controls.\nPrice controls come in two ways.\nA price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level.\nAnd, a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n18000\n15000 E0\nE1\n1200\n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE2\n1500\n7. Price controls\nA price floor is the lowest legal price that can be paid in the market.\nPrice floors are sometimes called price supports. \nBecause they support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE’\n1500\nE\n7. Price controls\nThe demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the \nincentives provided by these laws to control prices.\nAs a result, It will often lead to undesirable consequences. \nIt implies alternative policy tools can often achieve the desired goals of price \ncontrol laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs."

Maximization of the objective under the constraint (rationality)\n2. Maximization of the utility subject to the budget constraint\n•  Marginal analysis\n3.  Derivation of a demand curve\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Suppose there is a consumer whose name is Pepe. He is the representative agent of all customers in our \nsociety.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• We want to capture that consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and \nwant.\n• Pepe has 5,600 wons in spending money each week.\n• He can allocate this spending between meal ticket and shirts. \n• The meal tickets cost 700 wons each, and the shirts are 1,400 wons each.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Of course, the budget constraint diagram containing just two goods is not realistic. \n• Because, in a modern economy, people choose from thousands of goods.\n• However, thinking about a model with many goods can be just a straightforward extension of what we \ndiscussed here.\n• The point is that there is always a trade-off problem in decisions.\n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket\n8\n4\n• Each point on the line of \nbudget constraint \nrepresents a combination \nof meal tickets and shirts, \nwhich the total cost adds \nup to Pepe’s budget of \n5,600 won. \nClothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• If he spend out his budget, we can \nthink his budget constraint is actually \nthe outer line of the colored area.\n• If he had unlimited income or goods \nwere free, then he could consume \nwithout limit.  \n• Any point outside the constraint is \nnot affordable, because it would cost \nmore money than Pepe has in his \nbudget.\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• It just means that,\n𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒.\n• In this case,\n• Income = 5,600 wons\n• Expenditure = 700 M + 1,400 S\n• So, 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• To draw it in a 2-D plane,\n➢5600 = 700M + 1400S\n➢700M = 5600 – 1400S\n➢M = 8 – 2S\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• The slope of the budget constraint is \ndetermined by the relative price. \n• Relative price - How many meal \ntickets would Pepe have to give up to \nget one more shirt, while staying \nwithin his budget?\n• All along the budget set, getting 1 \nshirt means giving up 2 meal tickets.\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Economists call it opportunity cost.\n• Opportunity cost indicate what have to be given up to obtain something. In other words, opportunity cost \nis the value of the next best alternative.\n• For Pepe, the opportunity cost of 1 shirt is the 2 meal tickets. \n• He would decide to buy one more shirt, If the value of the extra shirt exceed the value of the alternative \n(2 meal tickets).\n1. Budget Constraint\n• A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost.\n• If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost might be the time which would be spent \nto make up the class.\n• If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. \n• In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price.\n• For example, attending graduate school is the case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. \nThe explicit costs of attending college might be about tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. \nBut in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a \npaying job. Thus, graduate school imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost \nearnings.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if the price of a good changes?\n• Suppose that, the price of bus ticket increased to 1,400 won.\n• A price increase for bus tickets would have no effect on the ability to purchase Ramen. \n• But it would reduce the number of bus tickets which Pepe could afford to buy.\n• What happens in the budget constraint? Redraw it. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if Pepe’s income changes?\n• Suppose that, his income drops as a half(=2,800 won).\n• In this case, it would reduce the number of both of meal tickets and shirts which Pepe could afford to buy. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n4\n2\n1. Budget Constraint\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n2. Utility\n• People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility from using those goods and services.\n• Utility is the term which economists use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction/usefulness or \nhappiness with his or her choices.\n• Of course, in our daily life, we don’t measure such a thing. But, in model, it can be a quite useful \ninstrument to replicate the underlying incentive structure of each individuals.\n2. Utility\nEconomists assume the feature of utility\n1.The more of some good one consumes, the more utility \none obtains.\n2. As a person consumes more of a good, the additional (or \nmarginal) utility from each additional unit of the good \ndeclines.\n2. Utility\n• It is a general pattern that consumption of the first few units of good tends to bring a higher level of \nutility than consumption of later units.\n• Suppose that you are in thirsty. You can compare the degree to which the first few drops of water relieve \nthe thirst and the extent to which the drinking water later resolves the thirst.\n• Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility.\n• It means that, the utility of a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more \nthan the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.\n2. Utility\n• The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing \nchoices. \n• Most of people would not say, “My favorite food is potato, so I will eat nothing but only potatoes from \nnow on.”\n• Even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the marginal \nutility from those last few servings would not be very high. \n2. Utility\n• An example for the marginal utilities for meal ticket (and shirt):\n𝑀𝑈𝑀 = 1\n𝑀\n𝑀𝑈𝑆 = 1\n𝑆\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n• The marginal approach is based on looking at the tradeoffs(measured in terms of marginal utility per \nspending) of consuming less of one good and more of another.\n• Marginal utility of X = additional utility from consuming 1 more unit (the smallest unit we can imagine) \nof X\n• Which decision is better? Check the marginal utilities.\n• But we have to consider that the prices are different.\n• Relative price indicates how much unit of Y can be exchanged with 1 more X.\n• Marginal utility per spending of X = marginal utility of X / price of X\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 1\n• Which decision is better? Comparing the marginal utilities per spending.\n• Suppose an initial state of X,Y . What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ? Can he/she better off (by changing in decision for \nX,Y)? Yes. Suppose that he/she get more X by giving up some Y .\n• What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ?\n• After all adjustments, we derive the rule of maximization \n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\n• Note that there is no incentive to deviate from the equality condition.\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 2\n• Suppose that he/she starts to spend money from 0.\n• To make the best decision, he/she would choose the plan with a higher marginal utility per spending. For \nexample, if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n, he/she will choose X.\n• Note that the marginal utility of one good decreases as he/she consume more. If he/she consume X more \nand more, \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n. In that case, he/she can get more utility by getting more Y and giving up some X.\n• That means, if he/she is rational, he/she will stick to the condition,\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\nMarginal analysis\n: The rule of maximization\n• If there are other goods (which means, in more general terms),\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n= ⋯ =\n𝑴𝑼𝒁\n𝑷𝒁\n.\n• The rule of maximization captures several important characteristics of consumers in market economy.\n• The relationship among consumptions on different items.\n• The effect of price change\n• The effect of income change\n• How the shape of marginal utilities affect consumption plan (and how the consumption plan responses to income/price change)?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Budget constraint : 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nUtility function : 𝑀𝑈𝑀 = \n1\n𝑀, 𝑀𝑈𝑆 = \n1\n𝑆\n• What is the optimal choice for M, S?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Now, let’s suppose that the income goes up to 11,200 won.\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nIncome effect\n• Income effect and the characteristics of good\n• Normal goods : an increase in income causes an increase in demand (+)\n• Inferior goods : an increase in income causes a decrease in demand (-)\n• Luxury goods : an increase in income causes a bigger percentage increase in demand (++)\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• What if the price of M goes to 1400 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• If the price of S falls to 700 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 8 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n8\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• When a price changes,\n• Substitution effect : change in relative price (the slope in budget constraint)\n• Income effect (of a price change) : shift in real purchasing power\nPrice effect\n• Price effect : an increase in price causes an decrease in demand (-)\n* Special case : Giffen goods – price effect (+)\n• Relationship between goods\n• Substitute goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\n• Complementary goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• Then, consider price effect on other good\n• On substitute goods : an increase in the price of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• On complementary goods : an increase in the price of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\nDemand curve\n• What is demand curve?

In the short run, we can classify the \ncosts into fixed costs and variable costs.\n◦ Fixed costs are the costs that cannot be changed in the short run.\n◦ Variable costs are the costs that can be changed.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of \nproduction, at least not in the short term.\n◦ For example, the cost of building factory or buying heavy equipment, research and \ndevelopment costs, advertising expenses. \n◦ The level of fixed costs varies according to the feature of the products or \nindustry. \n◦ For instance, manufacturing mobile phone or computer chips requires an \nexpensive factory. But, a food-truck or a painting artist can get by with \nrelatively less fixed costs.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Variable costs are incurred in the act of producing.\n◦ For example, wages and cost to buy intermediate goods are variable costs.\n◦ The more you produce, the greater the variable cost.\n◦ Total cost = fixed cost + variable cost.\nThe nature of production\n◦ Two assumptions:\n1.

Introduction\nIn this week, we will learn about:\n- Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for \nGoods and Services\n-   Shifts in Demand and Supply curves\n- Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity\n- Price Ceilings and Price Floors\nMarket Equilibrium\nFirm\n1\nFirm\n2\nFirm\n3\nFirm\n4\nFirm\n5\nGood & \nservice \nmarket\nProduction \nfactor \nmarket\n1. Demand curve\nDemand the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able \nto purchase at each price. \nDemand for each good and services can be obtained by individual consumer’s \npreference and their budgets.\nDemand represent the amount of wiliness to pay of the society. \n1. Demand curve\nThe total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity \ndemanded. \nSo, In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. \nDemand is mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities \ndemanded at those prices.\n1. Demand curve\nP         Q\nP         Q \nEconomists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity \ndemanded the law of demand. \nThe law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand are \nheld constant.\n1. Demand curve\nQ\nP\n1. Demand curve\nDemand curves can somewhat different for each product. \nThey may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. \nNearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope \ndown from left to right. \n2. Supply curve\nQuantity supplied means the amount of some good or service a producer is \nwilling to supply at each price. \nPrice is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. \nA rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of \nthat good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied.\n2. Supply curve\nQ\nP\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n18000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nWhat will be happened in next?\nSome chicken houses can not sell their chickens. So, Raw chickens, oils, flours \nat their storages starts to go bad.\nSome chicken houses will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a \nlower price than not to sell at all. \nSo, if the price is above the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to fall toward the equilibrium.\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n12000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nConsumers always are waiting their order and chicken houses says that they \nare filled with orders and there are no more stock of raw meats.\nIt’s not difficult for chicken houses to realize that even if they raise the price, \nthey can sell their stock out.\nSo, if the price is below the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to rise toward the equilibrium.\n4. Equilibrium\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nQ* = 1000\nP*\n=15000\nE\nE’\n4. Equilibrium\nThe word “equilibrium” means “balance.” \nIf a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason to \nmove away from that point. \nHowever, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise to \nmove the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.\n4. Equilibrium\nIn 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether \nsupply or demand determined a price was like arguing\n“whether it is the upper or the \nunder blade of a pair of \nscissors that cuts a piece of \npaper.” \n5. Shift of demand curve\nPrice, however, is not the only thing that influences demand and supply.\nWhat if overall consumer’s income has changed? \nSometime preferences can be suddenly changed.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \n5. Shift of demand curve\nQ\nP\nD0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nD1\nD2\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDoes the higher income always bring greater demand?\nA product whose demand rises when income rises is called a normal good.\nbut, there is a few exceptions to this pattern do exist. \nA product whose demand falls when income rises is called an inferior good. \n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnd, for some goods such as luxury cars, fine cuisines, or jewelry, the effect of \na rise in income can be especially pronounced.\nWe called those luxury goods.\nA luxury good is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally \nas income rises, \n5. Shift of demand curve\nOf course, income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand.\nWe can think about some of other factors that shift demand curves.\nOne of those is changing tastes or preferences.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \nIt might cause a severe avoiding to eat chickens.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDemographic changes can also be a important factor.\nActually, the demographic changes is combined with the changes in preference.\nSince the consumption preference of youth and old person is quite different, \nchanges in the demographic structure directly affects the overall preference of \nthe society.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnother example is the housing demand.\nSince the demand for owning houses is usually peaked in the middle age about \n40s, the overall housing demand can also be peaked, when the number of \nmiddle-aged in the country is the highest level.\nSome economists have tried to predict the future housing prices by using \npredictable demographic changes.\nMankiw, N. G., & Weil, D. N. (1989). The baby boom, the baby bust, and the \nhousing market. Regional science and urban economics, 19(2), 235-258.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nIt is also true that expectations about the future price (or expectations about \ntastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand.\nFor example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the \nstore to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. \nThese changes can push the demand curve to the right.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nOne interest thing is that some goods can be seriously affected by the \nexpectation.\nFor example, we can think about housing market.\nDemand for housing is not only determined  by preferences, but also by the \nexpectations for capital gain.\nThis feature of housing markets sometimes causes speculations in housing \nmarkets.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nHow about the supply curves? \nOne of most important factor affecting the supply curve might be the \nproduction cost.\nIf a firm faces lower costs of production, a firm’s profits go up. This can be \nshown by the supply curve shifting to the right.\nif a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any \ngiven selling price for its products. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the \nleft.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nQ\nP\nS0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nS1 S2\n6. Shift of supply curve\nSeveral other things affect the cost of production, too. \nWe can think about new technologies for production, and some government \npolicies.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nWhen producers develops or discovers a technology that allows the firm to \nproduce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right, as well. \nThink about the cost of raising a chicken in chicken farm and the poultry \nfactory system.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nGovernment policies also can affect the cost of production and the supply \ncurve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies.\nA subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces the \nfirm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. \nFrom the firm’s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of \nproduction that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower \nquantity at every given price. \nSo, government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at \nevery given price, shifting supply to the right.\n7. Price controls\nIn some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on politicians\n7. Price controls\nLaws that government enacts to regulate prices are called Price controls.\nPrice controls come in two ways.\nA price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level.\nAnd, a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n18000\n15000 E0\nE1\n1200\n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE2\n1500\n7. Price controls\nA price floor is the lowest legal price that can be paid in the market.\nPrice floors are sometimes called price supports. \nBecause they support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE’\n1500\nE\n7. Price controls\nThe demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the \nincentives provided by these laws to control prices.\nAs a result, It will often lead to undesirable consequences. \nIt implies alternative policy tools can often achieve the desired goals of price \ncontrol laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs."

Budget Constraint\n• Suppose there is a consumer whose name is Pepe. He is the representative agent of all customers in our \nsociety.\n\n1. Budget Constraint\n• We want to capture that consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and \nwant.\n• Pepe has 5,600 wons in spending money each week.\n• He can allocate this spending between meal ticket and shirts. \n• The meal tickets cost 700 wons each, and the shirts are 1,400 wons each.\n\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Of course, the budget constraint diagram containing just two goods is not realistic. \n• Because, in a modern economy, people choose from thousands of goods.\n• However, thinking about a model with many goods can be just a straightforward extension of what we \ndiscussed here.\n• The point is that there is always a trade-off problem in decisions.\n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket\n8\n4\n• Each point on the line of \nbudget constraint \nrepresents a combination \nof meal tickets and shirts, \nwhich the total cost adds \nup to Pepe’s budget of \n5,600 won. \nClothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• If he spend out his budget, we can \nthink his budget constraint is actually \nthe outer line of the colored area.\n• If he had unlimited income or goods \nwere free, then he could consume \nwithout limit.  \n• Any point outside the constraint is \nnot affordable, because it would cost \nmore money than Pepe has in his \nbudget.\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• It just means that,\n𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒.\n• In this case,\n• Income = 5,600 wons\n• Expenditure = 700 M + 1,400 S\n• So, 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• To draw it in a 2-D plane,\n➢5600 = 700M + 1400S\n➢700M = 5600 – 1400S\n➢M = 8 – 2S\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• The slope of the budget constraint is \ndetermined by the relative price. \n• Relative price - How many meal \ntickets would Pepe have to give up to \nget one more shirt, while staying \nwithin his budget?\n• All along the budget set, getting 1 \nshirt means giving up 2 meal tickets.\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Economists call it opportunity cost.\n• Opportunity cost indicate what have to be given up to obtain something. In other words, opportunity cost \nis the value of the next best alternative.\n• For Pepe, the opportunity cost of 1 shirt is the 2 meal tickets. \n• He would decide to buy one more shirt, If the value of the extra shirt exceed the value of the alternative \n(2 meal tickets).\n1. Budget Constraint\n• A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost.\n• If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost might be the time which would be spent \nto make up the class.\n• If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. \n• In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price.\n• For example, attending graduate school is the case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. \nThe explicit costs of attending college might be about tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. \nBut in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a \npaying job. Thus, graduate school imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost \nearnings.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if the price of a good changes?\n• Suppose that, the price of bus ticket increased to 1,400 won.\n• A price increase for bus tickets would have no effect on the ability to purchase Ramen. \n• But it would reduce the number of bus tickets which Pepe could afford to buy.\n• What happens in the budget constraint? Redraw it. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if Pepe’s income changes?\n• Suppose that, his income drops as a half(=2,800 won).\n• In this case, it would reduce the number of both of meal tickets and shirts which Pepe could afford to buy. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n4\n2\n1. Budget Constraint\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n2. Utility\n• People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility from using those goods and services.\n• Utility is the term which economists use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction/usefulness or \nhappiness with his or her choices.\n• Of course, in our daily life, we don’t measure such a thing. But, in model, it can be a quite useful \ninstrument to replicate the underlying incentive structure of each individuals.\n2. Utility\nEconomists assume the feature of utility\n1.The more of some good one consumes, the more utility \none obtains.\n2. As a person consumes more of a good, the additional (or \nmarginal) utility from each additional unit of the good \ndeclines.\n2. Utility\n• It is a general pattern that consumption of the first few units of good tends to bring a higher level of \nutility than consumption of later units.\n• Suppose that you are in thirsty. You can compare the degree to which the first few drops of water relieve \nthe thirst and the extent to which the drinking water later resolves the thirst.\n• Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility.\n• It means that, the utility of a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more \nthan the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.\n2. Utility\n• The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing \nchoices. \n• Most of people would not say, “My favorite food is potato, so I will eat nothing but only potatoes from \nnow on.”\n• Even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the marginal \nutility from those last few servings would not be very high. \n2. Utility\n• An example for the marginal utilities for meal ticket (and shirt):\n𝑀𝑈𝑀 = 1\n𝑀\n𝑀𝑈𝑆 = 1\n𝑆\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n• The marginal approach is based on looking at the tradeoffs(measured in terms of marginal utility per \nspending) of consuming less of one good and more of another.\n• Marginal utility of X = additional utility from consuming 1 more unit (the smallest unit we can imagine) \nof X\n• Which decision is better? Check the marginal utilities.\n• But we have to consider that the prices are different.\n• Relative price indicates how much unit of Y can be exchanged with 1 more X.\n• Marginal utility per spending of X = marginal utility of X / price of X\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 1\n• Which decision is better? Comparing the marginal utilities per spending.\n• Suppose an initial state of X,Y . What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n>\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ? Can he/she better off (by changing in decision for \nX,Y)? Yes. Suppose that he/she get more X by giving up some Y . \n• What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n<\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ?\n• After all adjustments, we derive the rule of maximization \n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\n• Note that there is no incentive to deviate from the equality condition.\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 2\n• Suppose that he/she starts to spend money from 0.\n• To make the best decision, he/she would choose the plan with a higher marginal utility per spending. For \nexample, if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n>\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n, he/she will choose X.\n• Note that the marginal utility of one good decreases as he/she consume more. If he/she consume X more \nand more, \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n<\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n. In that case, he/she can get more utility by getting more Y and giving up some X.\n• That means, if he/she is rational, he/she will stick to the condition,\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\nMarginal analysis\n: The rule of maximization\n• If there are other goods (which means, in more general terms),\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n= ⋯ =\n𝑴𝑼𝒁\n𝑷𝒁\n.\n• The rule of maximization captures several important characteristics of consumers in market economy.\n• The relationship among consumptions on different items.\n• The effect of price change\n• The effect of income change\n• How the shape of marginal utilities affect consumption plan (and how the consumption plan responses to income/price change)?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Budget constraint : 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nUtility function : 𝑀𝑈𝑀 =\n1\n𝑀, 𝑀𝑈𝑆 =\n1\n𝑆\n• What is the optimal choice for M, S?\n\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Now, let’s suppose that the income goes up to 11,200 won.\n\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nIncome effect\n• Income effect and the characteristics of good\n• Normal goods : an increase in income causes an increase in demand (+)\n• Inferior goods : an increase in income causes a decrease in demand (-)\n• Luxury goods : an increase in income causes a bigger percentage increase in demand (++)\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• What if the price of M goes to 1400 won ?\n\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• If the price of S falls to 700 won ?\n\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 8 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n8\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• When a price changes,\n• Substitution effect : change in relative price (the slope in budget constraint)\n• Income effect (of a price change) : shift in real purchasing power\n\nPrice effect\n• Price effect : an increase in price causes an decrease in demand (-)\n* Special case : Giffen goods – price effect (+)\n• Relationship between goods\n• Substitute goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\n• Complementary goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• Then, consider price effect on other good\n• On substitute goods : an increase in the price of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• On complementary goods : an increase in the price of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\nDemand curve\n• What is demand curve? The relationship between price and quantity demanded\n• What is the quantity demanded? We know what occurs if consumers follow their self-interest. => The \noptimal decision of consumption\n• Remind that price effect is negative (-).\nThanks!!"

Law of diminishing marginal production\n◦ Marginal product of any input : the additional quantity of output obtained \nfrom one additional unit of that input.\nExample : Pepe’s chicken house\n◦ Assume that the fixed costs of operating the chicken house, including the space and \nequipment, are 100.\n◦ The variable costs are the costs of hiring worker, which in our example is 50 per deliver. \n◦ Variable cost :  price of input  x  quantity of input.\n◦ When one unit of the input (worker) is added, the cost would be increased as much as the \nprice of the input (50 for the wage).\n\nExample : cost structure of the \nchicken house\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\n1 10\n2 18\n3 24\n4 28\n5 30\n6 31\n7 31.5\nThe law of diminishing marginal \nproduction\n\nExample : revenue of the chicken \nhouse\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nToral revenue Additional rev \n(from 1 more \nworker)\n1 10 300 300\n2 18 540 240\n3 24 720 180\n4 28 840 120\n5 30 900 60\n6 31 930 30\n7 31.5 945 15\nLet’s assume the \nprice of 1 chicken \n= 30!\nExample : cost structure of the \nchicken house\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nFixed cost Variable \ncost\nTotal cost Additional cost \n(1 worker)\n1 10 100 50 150 50\n2 18 100 100 200 50\n3 24 100 150 250 50\n4 28 100 200 300 50\n5 30 100 250 350 50\n6 31 100 300 400 50\n7 31.5 100 350 450 50\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nAdditional cost \n(1 worker)\nAdditional rev \n(1 worker)\n1 10 50 300\n2 18 50 240\n3 24 50 180\n4 28 50 120\n5 30 50 60\n6 31 50 30\n7 31.5 50 15\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nAdditional cost \n(1 worker)\nAdditional rev \n(1 worker)\n1 10 50 300\n2 18 50 240\n3 24 50 180\n4 28 50 120\n5 30 50 60\n6 31 50 30\n7 31.5 50 15\nMR = MC\nThe production function\n◦ We've discussed about the production cost, by using a \nproduction table.\n◦ Now, we can use the production function instead of the \nproduction table.\n◦ And then, from the production function, we can derive of each \ncost functions.\nThe production function\n◦ As the utility function, the form of the production function is \nusually assumed.\n◦ In our case, I assume a production function with the pattern of \ndiminishing marginal product.\n◦ Because this form is one of the basic form of production \nfunction which economists usually uses.\n• Functions and graphs\n• The concept of differentiation\n• Formulas for differentiation\nPreparations\n• Function : a special type of relation between X and Y .

Introduction\nIn this week, we will learn about:\n- Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for \nGoods and Services\n-   Shifts in Demand and Supply curves\n- Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity\n- Price Ceilings and Price Floors\nMarket Equilibrium\nFirm\n1\nFirm\n2\nFirm\n3\nFirm\n4\nFirm\n5\nGood & \nservice \nmarket\nProduction \nfactor \nmarket\n\n1. Demand curve\nDemand the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able \nto purchase at each price. \nDemand for each good and services can be obtained by individual consumer’s \npreference and their budgets.\nDemand represent the amount of wiliness to pay of the society. \n1. Demand curve\nThe total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity \ndemanded. \nSo, In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. \nDemand is mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities \ndemanded at those prices.\n1. Demand curve\nP         Q\nP         Q \nEconomists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity \ndemanded the law of demand. \nThe law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand are \nheld constant.\n1. Demand curve\nQ\nP\n1. Demand curve\nDemand curves can somewhat different for each product. \nThey may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. \nNearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope \ndown from left to right. \n2. Supply curve\nQuantity supplied means the amount of some good or service a producer is \nwilling to supply at each price. \nPrice is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. \nA rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of \nthat good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied.\n2. Supply curve\nQ\nP\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n18000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nWhat will be happened in next?\nSome chicken houses can not sell their chickens. So, Raw chickens, oils, flours \nat their storages starts to go bad.\nSome chicken houses will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a \nlower price than not to sell at all. \nSo, if the price is above the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to fall toward the equilibrium.\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n12000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nConsumers always are waiting their order and chicken houses says that they \nare filled with orders and there are no more stock of raw meats.\nIt’s not difficult for chicken houses to realize that even if they raise the price, \nthey can sell their stock out.\nSo, if the price is below the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to rise toward the equilibrium.\n4. Equilibrium\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nQ* = 1000\nP*\n=15000\nE\nE’\n4. Equilibrium\nThe word “equilibrium” means “balance.” \nIf a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason to \nmove away from that point. \nHowever, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise to \nmove the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.\n4. Equilibrium\nIn 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether \nsupply or demand determined a price was like arguing\n“whether it is the upper or the \nunder blade of a pair of \nscissors that cuts a piece of \npaper.” \n\n5. Shift of demand curve\nPrice, however, is not the only thing that influences demand and supply.\nWhat if overall consumer’s income has changed? \nSometime preferences can be suddenly changed.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \n5. Shift of demand curve\nQ\nP\nD0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nD1\nD2\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDoes the higher income always bring greater demand?\nA product whose demand rises when income rises is called a normal good.\nbut, there is a few exceptions to this pattern do exist. \nA product whose demand falls when income rises is called an inferior good. \n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnd, for some goods such as luxury cars, fine cuisines, or jewelry, the effect of \na rise in income can be especially pronounced.\nWe called those luxury goods.\nA luxury good is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally \nas income rises, \n5. Shift of demand curve\nOf course, income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand.\nWe can think about some of other factors that shift demand curves.\nOne of those is changing tastes or preferences.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \nIt might cause a severe avoiding to eat chickens.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDemographic changes can also be a important factor.\nActually, the demographic changes is combined with the changes in preference.\nSince the consumption preference of youth and old person is quite different, \nchanges in the demographic structure directly affects the overall preference of \nthe society.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnother example is the housing demand.\nSince the demand for owning houses is usually peaked in the middle age about \n40s, the overall housing demand can also be peaked, when the number of \nmiddle-aged in the country is the highest level.\nSome economists have tried to predict the future housing prices by using \npredictable demographic changes.\nMankiw, N. G., & Weil, D. N. (1989). The baby boom, the baby bust, and the \nhousing market. Regional science and urban economics, 19(2), 235-258.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nIt is also true that expectations about the future price (or expectations about \ntastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand.\nFor example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the \nstore to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. \nThese changes can push the demand curve to the right.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nOne interest thing is that some goods can be seriously affected by the \nexpectation.\nFor example, we can think about housing market.\nDemand for housing is not only determined  by preferences, but also by the \nexpectations for capital gain.\nThis feature of housing markets sometimes causes speculations in housing \nmarkets.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nHow about the supply curves? \nOne of most important factor affecting the supply curve might be the \nproduction cost.\nIf a firm faces lower costs of production, a firm’s profits go up. This can be \nshown by the supply curve shifting to the right.\nif a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any \ngiven selling price for its products. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the \nleft.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nQ\nP\nS0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nS1 S2\n6. Shift of supply curve\nSeveral other things affect the cost of production, too. \nWe can think about new technologies for production, and some government \npolicies.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nWhen producers develops or discovers a technology that allows the firm to \nproduce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right, as well. \nThink about the cost of raising a chicken in chicken farm and the poultry \nfactory system.\n\n6. Shift of supply curve\nGovernment policies also can affect the cost of production and the supply \ncurve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies.\nA subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces the \nfirm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. \nFrom the firm’s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of \nproduction that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower \nquantity at every given price. \nSo, government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at \nevery given price, shifting supply to the right.\n7. Price controls\nIn some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on politicians\n\n7. Price controls\nLaws that government enacts to regulate prices are called Price controls.\nPrice controls come in two ways.\nA price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level.\nAnd, a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n18000\n15000 E0\nE1\n1200\n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE2\n1500\n7. Price controls\nA price floor is the lowest legal price that can be paid in the market.\nPrice floors are sometimes called price supports. \nBecause they support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE’\n1500\nE\n7. Price controls\nThe demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the \nincentives provided by these laws to control prices.\nAs a result, It will often lead to undesirable consequences. \nIt implies alternative policy tools can often achieve the desired goals of price \ncontrol laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs."

Budget Constraint\n• Suppose there is a consumer whose name is Pepe. He is the representative agent of all customers in our \nsociety.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• We want to capture that consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and \nwant.\n• Pepe has 5,600 wons in spending money each week.\n• He can allocate this spending between meal ticket and shirts. \n• The meal tickets cost 700 wons each, and the shirts are 1,400 wons each.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Of course, the budget constraint diagram containing just two goods is not realistic. \n• Because, in a modern economy, people choose from thousands of goods.\n• However, thinking about a model with many goods can be just a straightforward extension of what we \ndiscussed here.\n• The point is that there is always a trade-off problem in decisions.\n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket\n8\n4\n• Each point on the line of \nbudget constraint \nrepresents a combination \nof meal tickets and shirts, \nwhich the total cost adds \nup to Pepe’s budget of \n5,600 won. \nClothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• If he spend out his budget, we can \nthink his budget constraint is actually \nthe outer line of the colored area.\n• If he had unlimited income or goods \nwere free, then he could consume \nwithout limit.  \n• Any point outside the constraint is \nnot affordable, because it would cost \nmore money than Pepe has in his \nbudget.\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• It just means that,\n𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒.\n• In this case,\n• Income = 5,600 wons\n• Expenditure = 700 M + 1,400 S\n• So, 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• To draw it in a 2-D plane,\n➢5600 = 700M + 1400S\n➢700M = 5600 – 1400S\n➢M = 8 – 2S\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• The slope of the budget constraint is \ndetermined by the relative price. \n• Relative price - How many meal \ntickets would Pepe have to give up to \nget one more shirt, while staying \nwithin his budget?\n• All along the budget set, getting 1 \nshirt means giving up 2 meal tickets.\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Economists call it opportunity cost.\n• Opportunity cost indicate what have to be given up to obtain something. In other words, opportunity cost \nis the value of the next best alternative.\n• For Pepe, the opportunity cost of 1 shirt is the 2 meal tickets. \n• He would decide to buy one more shirt, If the value of the extra shirt exceed the value of the alternative \n(2 meal tickets).\n1. Budget Constraint\n• A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost.\n• If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost might be the time which would be spent \nto make up the class.\n• If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. \n• In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price.\n• For example, attending graduate school is the case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. \nThe explicit costs of attending college might be about tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. \nBut in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a \npaying job. Thus, graduate school imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost \nearnings.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if the price of a good changes?\n• Suppose that, the price of bus ticket increased to 1,400 won.\n• A price increase for bus tickets would have no effect on the ability to purchase Ramen. \n• But it would reduce the number of bus tickets which Pepe could afford to buy.\n• What happens in the budget constraint? Redraw it. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if Pepe’s income changes?\n• Suppose that, his income drops as a half(=2,800 won).\n• In this case, it would reduce the number of both of meal tickets and shirts which Pepe could afford to buy. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n4\n2\n1. Budget Constraint\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n2. Utility\n• People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility from using those goods and services.\n• Utility is the term which economists use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction/usefulness or \nhappiness with his or her choices.\n• Of course, in our daily life, we don’t measure such a thing. But, in model, it can be a quite useful \ninstrument to replicate the underlying incentive structure of each individuals.\n2. Utility\nEconomists assume the feature of utility\n1.The more of some good one consumes, the more utility \none obtains.\n2. As a person consumes more of a good, the additional (or \nmarginal) utility from each additional unit of the good \ndeclines.\n2. Utility\n• It is a general pattern that consumption of the first few units of good tends to bring a higher level of \nutility than consumption of later units.\n• Suppose that you are in thirsty. You can compare the degree to which the first few drops of water relieve \nthe thirst and the extent to which the drinking water later resolves the thirst.\n• Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility.\n• It means that, the utility of a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more \nthan the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.\n2. Utility\n• The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing \nchoices. \n• Most of people would not say, “My favorite food is potato, so I will eat nothing but only potatoes from \nnow on.”\n• Even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the marginal \nutility from those last few servings would not be very high. \n2. Utility\n• An example for the marginal utilities for meal ticket (and shirt):\n𝑀𝑈𝑀 = 1\n𝑀\n𝑀𝑈𝑆 = 1\n𝑆\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n• The marginal approach is based on looking at the tradeoffs(measured in terms of marginal utility per \nspending) of consuming less of one good and more of another.\n• Marginal utility of X = additional utility from consuming 1 more unit (the smallest unit we can imagine) \nof X\n• Which decision is better? Check the marginal utilities.\n• But we have to consider that the prices are different.\n• Relative price indicates how much unit of Y can be exchanged with 1 more X.\n• Marginal utility per spending of X = marginal utility of X / price of X\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 1\n• Which decision is better? Comparing the marginal utilities per spending.\n• Suppose an initial state of X,Y . What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ? Can he/she better off (by changing in decision for \nX,Y)? Yes. Suppose that he/she get more X by giving up some Y .\n• What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ?\n• After all adjustments, we derive the rule of maximization \n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\n• Note that there is no incentive to deviate from the equality condition.\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 2\n• Suppose that he/she starts to spend money from 0.\n• To make the best decision, he/she would choose the plan with a higher marginal utility per spending. For \nexample, if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n, he/she will choose X.\n• Note that the marginal utility of one good decreases as he/she consume more. If he/she consume X more \nand more, \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n. In that case, he/she can get more utility by getting more Y and giving up some X.\n• That means, if he/she is rational, he/she will stick to the condition,\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\nMarginal analysis\n: The rule of maximization\n• If there are other goods (which means, in more general terms),\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n= ⋯ =\n𝑴𝑼𝒁\n𝑷𝒁\n.\n• The rule of maximization captures several important characteristics of consumers in market economy.\n• The relationship among consumptions on different items.\n• The effect of price change\n• The effect of income change\n• How the shape of marginal utilities affect consumption plan (and how the consumption plan responses to income/price change)?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Budget constraint : 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nUtility function : 𝑀𝑈𝑀 = \n1\n𝑀, 𝑀𝑈𝑆 = \n1\n𝑆\n• What is the optimal choice for M, S?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Now, let’s suppose that the income goes up to 11,200 won.\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nIncome effect\n• Income effect and the characteristics of good\n• Normal goods : an increase in income causes an increase in demand (+)\n• Inferior goods : an increase in income causes a decrease in demand (-)\n• Luxury goods : an increase in income causes a bigger percentage increase in demand (++)\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• What if the price of M goes to 1400 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• If the price of S falls to 700 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 8 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n8\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• When a price changes,\n• Substitution effect : change in relative price (the slope in budget constraint)\n• Income effect (of a price change) : shift in real purchasing power\nPrice effect\n• Price effect : an increase in price causes an decrease in demand (-)\n* Special case : Giffen goods – price effect (+)\n• Relationship between goods\n• Substitute goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\n• Complementary goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• Then, consider price effect on other good\n• On substitute goods : an increase in the price of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• On complementary goods : an increase in the price of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\nDemand curve\n• What is demand curve?

In the short run, we can classify the \ncosts into fixed costs and variable costs.\n◦ Fixed costs are the costs that cannot be changed in the short run.\n◦ Variable costs are the costs that can be changed.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of \nproduction, at least not in the short term.\n◦ For example, the cost of building factory or buying heavy equipment, research and \ndevelopment costs, advertising expenses. \n◦ The level of fixed costs varies according to the feature of the products or \nindustry. \n◦ For instance, manufacturing mobile phone or computer chips requires an \nexpensive factory. But, a food-truck or a painting artist can get by with \nrelatively less fixed costs.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Variable costs are incurred in the act of producing.\n◦ For example, wages and cost to buy intermediate goods are variable costs.\n◦ The more you produce, the greater the variable cost.\n◦ Total cost = fixed cost + variable cost.\nThe nature of production\n◦ Two assumptions:\n1.

Introduction\nIn this week, we will learn about:\n- Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for \nGoods and Services\n-   Shifts in Demand and Supply curves\n- Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity\n- Price Ceilings and Price Floors\nMarket Equilibrium\nFirm\n1\nFirm\n2\nFirm\n3\nFirm\n4\nFirm\n5\nGood & \nservice \nmarket\nProduction \nfactor \nmarket\n1. Demand curve\nDemand the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able \nto purchase at each price. \nDemand for each good and services can be obtained by individual consumer’s \npreference and their budgets.\nDemand represent the amount of wiliness to pay of the society. \n1. Demand curve\nThe total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity \ndemanded. \nSo, In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. \nDemand is mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities \ndemanded at those prices.\n1. Demand curve\nP         Q\nP         Q \nEconomists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity \ndemanded the law of demand. \nThe law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand are \nheld constant.\n1. Demand curve\nQ\nP\n1. Demand curve\nDemand curves can somewhat different for each product. \nThey may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. \nNearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope \ndown from left to right. \n2. Supply curve\nQuantity supplied means the amount of some good or service a producer is \nwilling to supply at each price. \nPrice is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. \nA rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of \nthat good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied.\n2. Supply curve\nQ\nP\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n18000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nWhat will be happened in next?\nSome chicken houses can not sell their chickens. So, Raw chickens, oils, flours \nat their storages starts to go bad.\nSome chicken houses will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a \nlower price than not to sell at all. \nSo, if the price is above the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to fall toward the equilibrium.\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n12000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nConsumers always are waiting their order and chicken houses says that they \nare filled with orders and there are no more stock of raw meats.\nIt’s not difficult for chicken houses to realize that even if they raise the price, \nthey can sell their stock out.\nSo, if the price is below the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to rise toward the equilibrium.\n4. Equilibrium\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nQ* = 1000\nP*\n=15000\nE\nE’\n4. Equilibrium\nThe word “equilibrium” means “balance.” \nIf a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason to \nmove away from that point. \nHowever, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise to \nmove the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.\n4. Equilibrium\nIn 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether \nsupply or demand determined a price was like arguing\n“whether it is the upper or the \nunder blade of a pair of \nscissors that cuts a piece of \npaper.” \n5. Shift of demand curve\nPrice, however, is not the only thing that influences demand and supply.\nWhat if overall consumer’s income has changed? \nSometime preferences can be suddenly changed.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \n5. Shift of demand curve\nQ\nP\nD0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nD1\nD2\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDoes the higher income always bring greater demand?\nA product whose demand rises when income rises is called a normal good.\nbut, there is a few exceptions to this pattern do exist. \nA product whose demand falls when income rises is called an inferior good. \n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnd, for some goods such as luxury cars, fine cuisines, or jewelry, the effect of \na rise in income can be especially pronounced.\nWe called those luxury goods.\nA luxury good is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally \nas income rises, \n5. Shift of demand curve\nOf course, income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand.\nWe can think about some of other factors that shift demand curves.\nOne of those is changing tastes or preferences.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \nIt might cause a severe avoiding to eat chickens.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDemographic changes can also be a important factor.\nActually, the demographic changes is combined with the changes in preference.\nSince the consumption preference of youth and old person is quite different, \nchanges in the demographic structure directly affects the overall preference of \nthe society.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnother example is the housing demand.\nSince the demand for owning houses is usually peaked in the middle age about \n40s, the overall housing demand can also be peaked, when the number of \nmiddle-aged in the country is the highest level.\nSome economists have tried to predict the future housing prices by using \npredictable demographic changes.\nMankiw, N. G., & Weil, D. N. (1989). The baby boom, the baby bust, and the \nhousing market. Regional science and urban economics, 19(2), 235-258.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nIt is also true that expectations about the future price (or expectations about \ntastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand.\nFor example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the \nstore to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. \nThese changes can push the demand curve to the right.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nOne interest thing is that some goods can be seriously affected by the \nexpectation.\nFor example, we can think about housing market.\nDemand for housing is not only determined  by preferences, but also by the \nexpectations for capital gain.\nThis feature of housing markets sometimes causes speculations in housing \nmarkets.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nHow about the supply curves? \nOne of most important factor affecting the supply curve might be the \nproduction cost.\nIf a firm faces lower costs of production, a firm’s profits go up. This can be \nshown by the supply curve shifting to the right.\nif a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any \ngiven selling price for its products. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the \nleft.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nQ\nP\nS0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nS1 S2\n6. Shift of supply curve\nSeveral other things affect the cost of production, too. \nWe can think about new technologies for production, and some government \npolicies.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nWhen producers develops or discovers a technology that allows the firm to \nproduce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right, as well. \nThink about the cost of raising a chicken in chicken farm and the poultry \nfactory system.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nGovernment policies also can affect the cost of production and the supply \ncurve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies.\nA subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces the \nfirm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. \nFrom the firm’s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of \nproduction that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower \nquantity at every given price. \nSo, government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at \nevery given price, shifting supply to the right.\n7. Price controls\nIn some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on politicians\n7. Price controls\nLaws that government enacts to regulate prices are called Price controls.\nPrice controls come in two ways.\nA price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level.\nAnd, a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n18000\n15000 E0\nE1\n1200\n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE2\n1500\n7. Price controls\nA price floor is the lowest legal price that can be paid in the market.\nPrice floors are sometimes called price supports. \nBecause they support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE’\n1500\nE\n7. Price controls\nThe demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the \nincentives provided by these laws to control prices.\nAs a result, It will often lead to undesirable consequences. \nIt implies alternative policy tools can often achieve the desired goals of price \ncontrol laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs."

Maximization of the objective under the constraint (rationality)\n2. Maximization of the utility subject to the budget constraint\n•  Marginal analysis\n3.  Derivation of a demand curve\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Suppose there is a consumer whose name is Pepe. He is the representative agent of all customers in our \nsociety.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• We want to capture that consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and \nwant.\n• Pepe has 5,600 wons in spending money each week.\n• He can allocate this spending between meal ticket and shirts. \n• The meal tickets cost 700 wons each, and the shirts are 1,400 wons each.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Of course, the budget constraint diagram containing just two goods is not realistic. \n• Because, in a modern economy, people choose from thousands of goods.\n• However, thinking about a model with many goods can be just a straightforward extension of what we \ndiscussed here.\n• The point is that there is always a trade-off problem in decisions.\n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket\n8\n4\n• Each point on the line of \nbudget constraint \nrepresents a combination \nof meal tickets and shirts, \nwhich the total cost adds \nup to Pepe’s budget of \n5,600 won. \nClothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• If he spend out his budget, we can \nthink his budget constraint is actually \nthe outer line of the colored area.\n• If he had unlimited income or goods \nwere free, then he could consume \nwithout limit.  \n• Any point outside the constraint is \nnot affordable, because it would cost \nmore money than Pepe has in his \nbudget.\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• It just means that,\n𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒.\n• In this case,\n• Income = 5,600 wons\n• Expenditure = 700 M + 1,400 S\n• So, 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• To draw it in a 2-D plane,\n➢5600 = 700M + 1400S\n➢700M = 5600 – 1400S\n➢M = 8 – 2S\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• The slope of the budget constraint is \ndetermined by the relative price. \n• Relative price - How many meal \ntickets would Pepe have to give up to \nget one more shirt, while staying \nwithin his budget?\n• All along the budget set, getting 1 \nshirt means giving up 2 meal tickets.\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Economists call it opportunity cost.\n• Opportunity cost indicate what have to be given up to obtain something. In other words, opportunity cost \nis the value of the next best alternative.\n• For Pepe, the opportunity cost of 1 shirt is the 2 meal tickets. \n• He would decide to buy one more shirt, If the value of the extra shirt exceed the value of the alternative \n(2 meal tickets).\n1. Budget Constraint\n• A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost.\n• If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost might be the time which would be spent \nto make up the class.\n• If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. \n• In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price.\n• For example, attending graduate school is the case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. \nThe explicit costs of attending college might be about tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. \nBut in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a \npaying job. Thus, graduate school imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost \nearnings.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if the price of a good changes?\n• Suppose that, the price of bus ticket increased to 1,400 won.\n• A price increase for bus tickets would have no effect on the ability to purchase Ramen. \n• But it would reduce the number of bus tickets which Pepe could afford to buy.\n• What happens in the budget constraint? Redraw it. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if Pepe’s income changes?\n• Suppose that, his income drops as a half(=2,800 won).\n• In this case, it would reduce the number of both of meal tickets and shirts which Pepe could afford to buy. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n4\n2\n1. Budget Constraint\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n2. Utility\n• People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility from using those goods and services.\n• Utility is the term which economists use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction/usefulness or \nhappiness with his or her choices.\n• Of course, in our daily life, we don’t measure such a thing. But, in model, it can be a quite useful \ninstrument to replicate the underlying incentive structure of each individuals.\n2. Utility\nEconomists assume the feature of utility\n1.The more of some good one consumes, the more utility \none obtains.\n2. As a person consumes more of a good, the additional (or \nmarginal) utility from each additional unit of the good \ndeclines.\n2. Utility\n• It is a general pattern that consumption of the first few units of good tends to bring a higher level of \nutility than consumption of later units.\n• Suppose that you are in thirsty. You can compare the degree to which the first few drops of water relieve \nthe thirst and the extent to which the drinking water later resolves the thirst.\n• Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility.\n• It means that, the utility of a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more \nthan the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.\n2. Utility\n• The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing \nchoices. \n• Most of people would not say, “My favorite food is potato, so I will eat nothing but only potatoes from \nnow on.”\n• Even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the marginal \nutility from those last few servings would not be very high. \n2. Utility\n• An example for the marginal utilities for meal ticket (and shirt):\n𝑀𝑈𝑀 = 1\n𝑀\n𝑀𝑈𝑆 = 1\n𝑆\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n• The marginal approach is based on looking at the tradeoffs(measured in terms of marginal utility per \nspending) of consuming less of one good and more of another.\n• Marginal utility of X = additional utility from consuming 1 more unit (the smallest unit we can imagine) \nof X\n• Which decision is better? Check the marginal utilities.\n• But we have to consider that the prices are different.\n• Relative price indicates how much unit of Y can be exchanged with 1 more X.\n• Marginal utility per spending of X = marginal utility of X / price of X\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 1\n• Which decision is better? Comparing the marginal utilities per spending.\n• Suppose an initial state of X,Y . What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ? Can he/she better off (by changing in decision for \nX,Y)? Yes. Suppose that he/she get more X by giving up some Y .\n• What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ?\n• After all adjustments, we derive the rule of maximization \n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\n• Note that there is no incentive to deviate from the equality condition.\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 2\n• Suppose that he/she starts to spend money from 0.\n• To make the best decision, he/she would choose the plan with a higher marginal utility per spending. For \nexample, if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n, he/she will choose X.\n• Note that the marginal utility of one good decreases as he/she consume more. If he/she consume X more \nand more, \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n. In that case, he/she can get more utility by getting more Y and giving up some X.\n• That means, if he/she is rational, he/she will stick to the condition,\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\nMarginal analysis\n: The rule of maximization\n• If there are other goods (which means, in more general terms),\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n= ⋯ =\n𝑴𝑼𝒁\n𝑷𝒁\n.\n• The rule of maximization captures several important characteristics of consumers in market economy.\n• The relationship among consumptions on different items.\n• The effect of price change\n• The effect of income change\n• How the shape of marginal utilities affect consumption plan (and how the consumption plan responses to income/price change)?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Budget constraint : 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nUtility function : 𝑀𝑈𝑀 = \n1\n𝑀, 𝑀𝑈𝑆 = \n1\n𝑆\n• What is the optimal choice for M, S?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Now, let’s suppose that the income goes up to 11,200 won.\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nIncome effect\n• Income effect and the characteristics of good\n• Normal goods : an increase in income causes an increase in demand (+)\n• Inferior goods : an increase in income causes a decrease in demand (-)\n• Luxury goods : an increase in income causes a bigger percentage increase in demand (++)\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• What if the price of M goes to 1400 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• If the price of S falls to 700 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 8 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n8\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• When a price changes,\n• Substitution effect : change in relative price (the slope in budget constraint)\n• Income effect (of a price change) : shift in real purchasing power\nPrice effect\n• Price effect : an increase in price causes an decrease in demand (-)\n* Special case : Giffen goods – price effect (+)\n• Relationship between goods\n• Substitute goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\n• Complementary goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• Then, consider price effect on other good\n• On substitute goods : an increase in the price of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• On complementary goods : an increase in the price of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\nDemand curve\n• What is demand curve? The relationship between price and quantity demanded\n• What is the quantity demanded?

In the short run, we can classify the \ncosts into fixed costs and variable costs.\n◦ Fixed costs are the costs that cannot be changed in the short run.\n◦ Variable costs are the costs that can be changed.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of \nproduction, at least not in the short term.\n◦ For example, the cost of building factory or buying heavy equipment, research and \ndevelopment costs, advertising expenses. \n◦ The level of fixed costs varies according to the feature of the products or \nindustry. \n◦ For instance, manufacturing mobile phone or computer chips requires an \nexpensive factory. But, a food-truck or a painting artist can get by with \nrelatively less fixed costs.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Variable costs are incurred in the act of producing.\n◦ For example, wages and cost to buy intermediate goods are variable costs.\n◦ The more you produce, the greater the variable cost.\n◦ Total cost = fixed cost + variable cost.\nThe nature of production\n◦ Two assumptions:\n1. Positivity (with respect to input)\n2. Law of diminishing marginal production\n◦ Marginal product of any input : the additional quantity of output obtained \nfrom one additional unit of that input.\nExample : Pepe’s chicken house\n◦ Assume that the fixed costs of operating the chicken house, including the space and \nequipment, are 100.\n◦ The variable costs are the costs of hiring worker, which in our example is 50 per deliver. \n◦ Variable cost :  price of input  x  quantity of input.\n◦ When one unit of the input (worker) is added, the cost would be increased as much as the \nprice of the input (50 for the wage).\nExample : cost structure of the \nchicken house\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\n1 10\n2 18\n3 24\n4 28\n5 30\n6 31\n7 31.5\nThe law of diminishing marginal \nproduction\nExample : revenue of the chicken \nhouse\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nToral revenue Additional rev \n(from 1 more \nworker)\n1 10 300 300\n2 18 540 240\n3 24 720 180\n4 28 840 120\n5 30 900 60\n6 31 930 30\n7 31.5 945 15\nLet’s assume the \nprice of 1 chicken \n= 30!\nExample : cost structure of the \nchicken house\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nFixed cost Variable \ncost\nTotal cost Additional cost \n(1 worker)\n1 10 100 50 150 50\n2 18 100 100 200 50\n3 24 100 150 250 50\n4 28 100 200 300 50\n5 30 100 250 350 50\n6 31 100 300 400 50\n7 31.5 100 350 450 50\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nAdditional cost \n(1 worker)\nAdditional rev \n(1 worker)\n1 10 50 300\n2 18 50 240\n3 24 50 180\n4 28 50 120\n5 30 50 60\n6 31 50 30\n7 31.5 50 15\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nAdditional cost \n(1 worker)\nAdditional rev \n(1 worker)\n1 10 50 300\n2 18 50 240\n3 24 50 180\n4 28 50 120\n5 30 50 60\n6 31 50 30\n7 31.5 50 15\nMR = MC\nThe production function\n◦ We've discussed about the production cost, by using a \nproduction table.\n◦ Now, we can use the production function instead of the \nproduction table.\n◦ And then, from the production function, we can derive of each \ncost functions.\nThe production function\n◦ As the utility function, the form of the production function is \nusually assumed.\n◦ In our case, I assume a production function with the pattern of \ndiminishing marginal product.\n◦ Because this form is one of the basic form of production \nfunction which economists usually uses.\n• Functions and graphs\n• The concept of differentiation\n• Formulas for differentiation\nPreparations\n• Function : a special type of relation between X and Y .

Introduction\nIn this week, we will learn about:\n- Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for \nGoods and Services\n-   Shifts in Demand and Supply curves\n- Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity\n- Price Ceilings and Price Floors\nMarket Equilibrium\nFirm\n1\nFirm\n2\nFirm\n3\nFirm\n4\nFirm\n5\nGood & \nservice \nmarket\nProduction \nfactor \nmarket\n1. Demand curve\nDemand the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able \nto purchase at each price. \nDemand for each good and services can be obtained by individual consumer’s \npreference and their budgets.\nDemand represent the amount of wiliness to pay of the society. \n1. Demand curve\nThe total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity \ndemanded. \nSo, In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. \nDemand is mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities \ndemanded at those prices.\n1. Demand curve\nP         Q\nP         Q \nEconomists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity \ndemanded the law of demand. \nThe law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand are \nheld constant.\n1. Demand curve\nQ\nP\n1. Demand curve\nDemand curves can somewhat different for each product. \nThey may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. \nNearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope \ndown from left to right. \n2. Supply curve\nQuantity supplied means the amount of some good or service a producer is \nwilling to supply at each price. \nPrice is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. \nA rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of \nthat good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied.\n2. Supply curve\nQ\nP\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n18000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nWhat will be happened in next?\nSome chicken houses can not sell their chickens. So, Raw chickens, oils, flours \nat their storages starts to go bad.\nSome chicken houses will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a \nlower price than not to sell at all. \nSo, if the price is above the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to fall toward the equilibrium.\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n12000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nConsumers always are waiting their order and chicken houses says that they \nare filled with orders and there are no more stock of raw meats.\nIt’s not difficult for chicken houses to realize that even if they raise the price, \nthey can sell their stock out.\nSo, if the price is below the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to rise toward the equilibrium.\n4. Equilibrium\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nQ* = 1000\nP*\n=15000\nE\nE’\n4. Equilibrium\nThe word “equilibrium” means “balance.” \nIf a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason to \nmove away from that point. \nHowever, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise to \nmove the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.\n4. Equilibrium\nIn 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether \nsupply or demand determined a price was like arguing\n“whether it is the upper or the \nunder blade of a pair of \nscissors that cuts a piece of \npaper.” \n5. Shift of demand curve\nPrice, however, is not the only thing that influences demand and supply.\nWhat if overall consumer’s income has changed? \nSometime preferences can be suddenly changed.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \n5. Shift of demand curve\nQ\nP\nD0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nD1\nD2\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDoes the higher income always bring greater demand?\nA product whose demand rises when income rises is called a normal good.\nbut, there is a few exceptions to this pattern do exist. \nA product whose demand falls when income rises is called an inferior good. \n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnd, for some goods such as luxury cars, fine cuisines, or jewelry, the effect of \na rise in income can be especially pronounced.\nWe called those luxury goods.\nA luxury good is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally \nas income rises, \n5. Shift of demand curve\nOf course, income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand.\nWe can think about some of other factors that shift demand curves.\nOne of those is changing tastes or preferences.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \nIt might cause a severe avoiding to eat chickens.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDemographic changes can also be a important factor.\nActually, the demographic changes is combined with the changes in preference.\nSince the consumption preference of youth and old person is quite different, \nchanges in the demographic structure directly affects the overall preference of \nthe society.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnother example is the housing demand.\nSince the demand for owning houses is usually peaked in the middle age about \n40s, the overall housing demand can also be peaked, when the number of \nmiddle-aged in the country is the highest level.\nSome economists have tried to predict the future housing prices by using \npredictable demographic changes.\nMankiw, N. G., & Weil, D. N. (1989). The baby boom, the baby bust, and the \nhousing market. Regional science and urban economics, 19(2), 235-258.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nIt is also true that expectations about the future price (or expectations about \ntastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand.\nFor example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the \nstore to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. \nThese changes can push the demand curve to the right.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nOne interest thing is that some goods can be seriously affected by the \nexpectation.\nFor example, we can think about housing market.\nDemand for housing is not only determined  by preferences, but also by the \nexpectations for capital gain.\nThis feature of housing markets sometimes causes speculations in housing \nmarkets.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nHow about the supply curves? \nOne of most important factor affecting the supply curve might be the \nproduction cost.\nIf a firm faces lower costs of production, a firm’s profits go up. This can be \nshown by the supply curve shifting to the right.\nif a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any \ngiven selling price for its products. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the \nleft.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nQ\nP\nS0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nS1 S2\n6. Shift of supply curve\nSeveral other things affect the cost of production, too. \nWe can think about new technologies for production, and some government \npolicies.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nWhen producers develops or discovers a technology that allows the firm to \nproduce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right, as well. \nThink about the cost of raising a chicken in chicken farm and the poultry \nfactory system.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nGovernment policies also can affect the cost of production and the supply \ncurve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies.\nA subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces the \nfirm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. \nFrom the firm’s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of \nproduction that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower \nquantity at every given price. \nSo, government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at \nevery given price, shifting supply to the right.\n7. Price controls\nIn some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on politicians\n7. Price controls\nLaws that government enacts to regulate prices are called Price controls.\nPrice controls come in two ways.\nA price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level.\nAnd, a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n18000\n15000 E0\nE1\n1200\n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE2\n1500\n7. Price controls\nA price floor is the lowest legal price that can be paid in the market.\nPrice floors are sometimes called price supports. \nBecause they support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE’\n1500\nE\n7. Price controls\nThe demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the \nincentives provided by these laws to control prices.\nAs a result, It will often lead to undesirable consequences. \nIt implies alternative policy tools can often achieve the desired goals of price \ncontrol laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs."

Maximization of the objective under the constraint (rationality)\n2. Maximization of the utility subject to the budget constraint\n•  Marginal analysis\n3.  Derivation of a demand curve\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Suppose there is a consumer whose name is Pepe. He is the representative agent of all customers in our \nsociety.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• We want to capture that consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and \nwant.\n• Pepe has 5,600 wons in spending money each week.\n• He can allocate this spending between meal ticket and shirts. \n• The meal tickets cost 700 wons each, and the shirts are 1,400 wons each.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Of course, the budget constraint diagram containing just two goods is not realistic. \n• Because, in a modern economy, people choose from thousands of goods.\n• However, thinking about a model with many goods can be just a straightforward extension of what we \ndiscussed here.\n• The point is that there is always a trade-off problem in decisions.\n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket\n8\n4\n• Each point on the line of \nbudget constraint \nrepresents a combination \nof meal tickets and shirts, \nwhich the total cost adds \nup to Pepe’s budget of \n5,600 won. \nClothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• If he spend out his budget, we can \nthink his budget constraint is actually \nthe outer line of the colored area.\n• If he had unlimited income or goods \nwere free, then he could consume \nwithout limit.  \n• Any point outside the constraint is \nnot affordable, because it would cost \nmore money than Pepe has in his \nbudget.\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• It just means that,\n𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒.\n• In this case,\n• Income = 5,600 wons\n• Expenditure = 700 M + 1,400 S\n• So, 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• To draw it in a 2-D plane,\n➢5600 = 700M + 1400S\n➢700M = 5600 – 1400S\n➢M = 8 – 2S\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• The slope of the budget constraint is \ndetermined by the relative price. \n• Relative price - How many meal \ntickets would Pepe have to give up to \nget one more shirt, while staying \nwithin his budget?\n• All along the budget set, getting 1 \nshirt means giving up 2 meal tickets.\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Economists call it opportunity cost.\n• Opportunity cost indicate what have to be given up to obtain something. In other words, opportunity cost \nis the value of the next best alternative.\n• For Pepe, the opportunity cost of 1 shirt is the 2 meal tickets. \n• He would decide to buy one more shirt, If the value of the extra shirt exceed the value of the alternative \n(2 meal tickets).\n1. Budget Constraint\n• A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost.\n• If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost might be the time which would be spent \nto make up the class.\n• If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. \n• In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price.\n• For example, attending graduate school is the case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. \nThe explicit costs of attending college might be about tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. \nBut in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a \npaying job. Thus, graduate school imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost \nearnings.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if the price of a good changes?\n• Suppose that, the price of bus ticket increased to 1,400 won.\n• A price increase for bus tickets would have no effect on the ability to purchase Ramen. \n• But it would reduce the number of bus tickets which Pepe could afford to buy.\n• What happens in the budget constraint? Redraw it. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if Pepe’s income changes?\n• Suppose that, his income drops as a half(=2,800 won).\n• In this case, it would reduce the number of both of meal tickets and shirts which Pepe could afford to buy. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n4\n2\n1. Budget Constraint\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n2. Utility\n• People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility from using those goods and services.\n• Utility is the term which economists use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction/usefulness or \nhappiness with his or her choices.\n• Of course, in our daily life, we don’t measure such a thing. But, in model, it can be a quite useful \ninstrument to replicate the underlying incentive structure of each individuals.\n2. Utility\nEconomists assume the feature of utility\n1.The more of some good one consumes, the more utility \none obtains.\n2. As a person consumes more of a good, the additional (or \nmarginal) utility from each additional unit of the good \ndeclines.\n2. Utility\n• It is a general pattern that consumption of the first few units of good tends to bring a higher level of \nutility than consumption of later units.\n• Suppose that you are in thirsty. You can compare the degree to which the first few drops of water relieve \nthe thirst and the extent to which the drinking water later resolves the thirst.\n• Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility.\n• It means that, the utility of a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more \nthan the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.\n2. Utility\n• The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing \nchoices. \n• Most of people would not say, “My favorite food is potato, so I will eat nothing but only potatoes from \nnow on.”\n• Even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the marginal \nutility from those last few servings would not be very high. \n2. Utility\n• An example for the marginal utilities for meal ticket (and shirt):\n𝑀𝑈𝑀 = 1\n𝑀\n𝑀𝑈𝑆 = 1\n𝑆\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n• The marginal approach is based on looking at the tradeoffs(measured in terms of marginal utility per \nspending) of consuming less of one good and more of another.\n• Marginal utility of X = additional utility from consuming 1 more unit (the smallest unit we can imagine) \nof X\n• Which decision is better? Check the marginal utilities.\n• But we have to consider that the prices are different.\n• Relative price indicates how much unit of Y can be exchanged with 1 more X.\n• Marginal utility per spending of X = marginal utility of X / price of X\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 1\n• Which decision is better? Comparing the marginal utilities per spending.\n• Suppose an initial state of X,Y . What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ? Can he/she better off (by changing in decision for \nX,Y)? Yes. Suppose that he/she get more X by giving up some Y .\n• What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ?\n• After all adjustments, we derive the rule of maximization \n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\n• Note that there is no incentive to deviate from the equality condition.\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 2\n• Suppose that he/she starts to spend money from 0.\n• To make the best decision, he/she would choose the plan with a higher marginal utility per spending. For \nexample, if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n, he/she will choose X.\n• Note that the marginal utility of one good decreases as he/she consume more. If he/she consume X more \nand more, \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n. In that case, he/she can get more utility by getting more Y and giving up some X.\n• That means, if he/she is rational, he/she will stick to the condition,\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\nMarginal analysis\n: The rule of maximization\n• If there are other goods (which means, in more general terms),\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n= ⋯ =\n𝑴𝑼𝒁\n𝑷𝒁\n.\n• The rule of maximization captures several important characteristics of consumers in market economy.\n• The relationship among consumptions on different items.\n• The effect of price change\n• The effect of income change\n• How the shape of marginal utilities affect consumption plan (and how the consumption plan responses to income/price change)?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Budget constraint : 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nUtility function : 𝑀𝑈𝑀 = \n1\n𝑀, 𝑀𝑈𝑆 = \n1\n𝑆\n• What is the optimal choice for M, S?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Now, let’s suppose that the income goes up to 11,200 won.\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nIncome effect\n• Income effect and the characteristics of good\n• Normal goods : an increase in income causes an increase in demand (+)\n• Inferior goods : an increase in income causes a decrease in demand (-)\n• Luxury goods : an increase in income causes a bigger percentage increase in demand (++)\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• What if the price of M goes to 1400 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• If the price of S falls to 700 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 8 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n8\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• When a price changes,\n• Substitution effect : change in relative price (the slope in budget constraint)\n• Income effect (of a price change) : shift in real purchasing power\nPrice effect\n• Price effect : an increase in price causes an decrease in demand (-)\n* Special case : Giffen goods – price effect (+)\n• Relationship between goods\n• Substitute goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\n• Complementary goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• Then, consider price effect on other good\n• On substitute goods : an increase in the price of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• On complementary goods : an increase in the price of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\nDemand curve\n• What is demand curve? The relationship between price and quantity demanded\n• What is the quantity demanded?

In the short run, we can classify the \ncosts into fixed costs and variable costs.\n◦ Fixed costs are the costs that cannot be changed in the short run.\n◦ Variable costs are the costs that can be changed.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of \nproduction, at least not in the short term.\n◦ For example, the cost of building factory or buying heavy equipment, research and \ndevelopment costs, advertising expenses. \n◦ The level of fixed costs varies according to the feature of the products or \nindustry. \n◦ For instance, manufacturing mobile phone or computer chips requires an \nexpensive factory. But, a food-truck or a painting artist can get by with \nrelatively less fixed costs.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Variable costs are incurred in the act of producing.\n◦ For example, wages and cost to buy intermediate goods are variable costs.\n◦ The more you produce, the greater the variable cost.\n◦ Total cost = fixed cost + variable cost.\nThe nature of production\n◦ Two assumptions:\n1. Positivity (with respect to input)\n2. Law of diminishing marginal production\n◦ Marginal product of any input : the additional quantity of output obtained \nfrom one additional unit of that input.\nExample : Pepe’s chicken house\n◦ Assume that the fixed costs of operating the chicken house, including the space and \nequipment, are 100.\n◦ The variable costs are the costs of hiring worker, which in our example is 50 per deliver. \n◦ Variable cost :  price of input  x  quantity of input.\n◦ When one unit of the input (worker) is added, the cost would be increased as much as the \nprice of the input (50 for the wage).\nExample : cost structure of the \nchicken house\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\n1 10\n2 18\n3 24\n4 28\n5 30\n6 31\n7 31.5\nThe law of diminishing marginal \nproduction\nExample : revenue of the chicken \nhouse\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nToral revenue Additional rev \n(from 1 more \nworker)\n1 10 300 300\n2 18 540 240\n3 24 720 180\n4 28 840 120\n5 30 900 60\n6 31 930 30\n7 31.5 945 15\nLet’s assume the \nprice of 1 chicken \n= 30!\nExample : cost structure of the \nchicken house\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nFixed cost Variable \ncost\nTotal cost Additional cost \n(1 worker)\n1 10 100 50 150 50\n2 18 100 100 200 50\n3 24 100 150 250 50\n4 28 100 200 300 50\n5 30 100 250 350 50\n6 31 100 300 400 50\n7 31.5 100 350 450 50\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nAdditional cost \n(1 worker)\nAdditional rev \n(1 worker)\n1 10 50 300\n2 18 50 240\n3 24 50 180\n4 28 50 120\n5 30 50 60\n6 31 50 30\n7 31.5 50 15\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nAdditional cost \n(1 worker)\nAdditional rev \n(1 worker)\n1 10 50 300\n2 18 50 240\n3 24 50 180\n4 28 50 120\n5 30 50 60\n6 31 50 30\n7 31.5 50 15\nMR = MC\nThe production function\n◦ We've discussed about the production cost, by using a \nproduction table.\n◦ Now, we can use the production function instead of the \nproduction table.\n◦ And then, from the production function, we can derive of each \ncost functions.\nThe production function\n◦ As the utility function, the form of the production function is \nusually assumed.\n◦ In our case, I assume a production function with the pattern of \ndiminishing marginal product.\n◦ Because this form is one of the basic form of production \nfunction which economists usually uses.\n• Functions and graphs\n• The concept of differentiation\n• Formulas for differentiation\nPreparations\n• Function : a special type of relation between X and Y .

Introduction\nIn this week, we will learn about:\n- Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for \nGoods and Services\n-   Shifts in Demand and Supply curves\n- Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity\n- Price Ceilings and Price Floors\nMarket Equilibrium\nFirm\n1\nFirm\n2\nFirm\n3\nFirm\n4\nFirm\n5\nGood & \nservice \nmarket\nProduction \nfactor \nmarket\n1. Demand curve\nDemand the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able \nto purchase at each price. \nDemand for each good and services can be obtained by individual consumer’s \npreference and their budgets.\nDemand represent the amount of wiliness to pay of the society. \n1. Demand curve\nThe total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity \ndemanded. \nSo, In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. \nDemand is mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities \ndemanded at those prices.\n1. Demand curve\nP         Q\nP         Q \nEconomists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity \ndemanded the law of demand. \nThe law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand are \nheld constant.\n1. Demand curve\nQ\nP\n1. Demand curve\nDemand curves can somewhat different for each product. \nThey may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. \nNearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope \ndown from left to right. \n2. Supply curve\nQuantity supplied means the amount of some good or service a producer is \nwilling to supply at each price. \nPrice is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. \nA rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of \nthat good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied.\n2. Supply curve\nQ\nP\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n18000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nWhat will be happened in next?\nSome chicken houses can not sell their chickens. So, Raw chickens, oils, flours \nat their storages starts to go bad.\nSome chicken houses will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a \nlower price than not to sell at all. \nSo, if the price is above the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to fall toward the equilibrium.\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n12000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nConsumers always are waiting their order and chicken houses says that they \nare filled with orders and there are no more stock of raw meats.\nIt’s not difficult for chicken houses to realize that even if they raise the price, \nthey can sell their stock out.\nSo, if the price is below the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to rise toward the equilibrium.\n4. Equilibrium\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nQ* = 1000\nP*\n=15000\nE\nE’\n4. Equilibrium\nThe word “equilibrium” means “balance.” \nIf a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason to \nmove away from that point. \nHowever, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise to \nmove the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.\n4. Equilibrium\nIn 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether \nsupply or demand determined a price was like arguing\n“whether it is the upper or the \nunder blade of a pair of \nscissors that cuts a piece of \npaper.” \n5. Shift of demand curve\nPrice, however, is not the only thing that influences demand and supply.\nWhat if overall consumer’s income has changed? \nSometime preferences can be suddenly changed.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \n5. Shift of demand curve\nQ\nP\nD0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nD1\nD2\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDoes the higher income always bring greater demand?\nA product whose demand rises when income rises is called a normal good.\nbut, there is a few exceptions to this pattern do exist. \nA product whose demand falls when income rises is called an inferior good. \n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnd, for some goods such as luxury cars, fine cuisines, or jewelry, the effect of \na rise in income can be especially pronounced.\nWe called those luxury goods.\nA luxury good is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally \nas income rises, \n5. Shift of demand curve\nOf course, income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand.\nWe can think about some of other factors that shift demand curves.\nOne of those is changing tastes or preferences.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \nIt might cause a severe avoiding to eat chickens.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDemographic changes can also be a important factor.\nActually, the demographic changes is combined with the changes in preference.\nSince the consumption preference of youth and old person is quite different, \nchanges in the demographic structure directly affects the overall preference of \nthe society.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnother example is the housing demand.\nSince the demand for owning houses is usually peaked in the middle age about \n40s, the overall housing demand can also be peaked, when the number of \nmiddle-aged in the country is the highest level.\nSome economists have tried to predict the future housing prices by using \npredictable demographic changes.\nMankiw, N. G., & Weil, D. N. (1989). The baby boom, the baby bust, and the \nhousing market. Regional science and urban economics, 19(2), 235-258.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nIt is also true that expectations about the future price (or expectations about \ntastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand.\nFor example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the \nstore to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. \nThese changes can push the demand curve to the right.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nOne interest thing is that some goods can be seriously affected by the \nexpectation.\nFor example, we can think about housing market.\nDemand for housing is not only determined  by preferences, but also by the \nexpectations for capital gain.\nThis feature of housing markets sometimes causes speculations in housing \nmarkets.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nHow about the supply curves? \nOne of most important factor affecting the supply curve might be the \nproduction cost.\nIf a firm faces lower costs of production, a firm’s profits go up. This can be \nshown by the supply curve shifting to the right.\nif a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any \ngiven selling price for its products. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the \nleft.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nQ\nP\nS0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nS1 S2\n6. Shift of supply curve\nSeveral other things affect the cost of production, too. \nWe can think about new technologies for production, and some government \npolicies.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nWhen producers develops or discovers a technology that allows the firm to \nproduce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right, as well. \nThink about the cost of raising a chicken in chicken farm and the poultry \nfactory system.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nGovernment policies also can affect the cost of production and the supply \ncurve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies.\nA subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces the \nfirm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. \nFrom the firm’s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of \nproduction that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower \nquantity at every given price. \nSo, government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at \nevery given price, shifting supply to the right.\n7. Price controls\nIn some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on politicians\n7. Price controls\nLaws that government enacts to regulate prices are called Price controls.\nPrice controls come in two ways.\nA price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level.\nAnd, a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n18000\n15000 E0\nE1\n1200\n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE2\n1500\n7. Price controls\nA price floor is the lowest legal price that can be paid in the market.\nPrice floors are sometimes called price supports. \nBecause they support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE’\n1500\nE\n7. Price controls\nThe demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the \nincentives provided by these laws to control prices.\nAs a result, It will often lead to undesirable consequences. \nIt implies alternative policy tools can often achieve the desired goals of price \ncontrol laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs."

Budget Constraint\n• Suppose there is a consumer whose name is Pepe. He is the representative agent of all customers in our \nsociety.\n\n1. Budget Constraint\n• We want to capture that consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and \nwant.\n• Pepe has 5,600 wons in spending money each week.\n• He can allocate this spending between meal ticket and shirts. \n• The meal tickets cost 700 wons each, and the shirts are 1,400 wons each.\n\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Of course, the budget constraint diagram containing just two goods is not realistic. \n• Because, in a modern economy, people choose from thousands of goods.\n• However, thinking about a model with many goods can be just a straightforward extension of what we \ndiscussed here.\n• The point is that there is always a trade-off problem in decisions.\n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket\n8\n4\n• Each point on the line of \nbudget constraint \nrepresents a combination \nof meal tickets and shirts, \nwhich the total cost adds \nup to Pepe’s budget of \n5,600 won. \nClothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• If he spend out his budget, we can \nthink his budget constraint is actually \nthe outer line of the colored area.\n• If he had unlimited income or goods \nwere free, then he could consume \nwithout limit.  \n• Any point outside the constraint is \nnot affordable, because it would cost \nmore money than Pepe has in his \nbudget.\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• It just means that,\n𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒.\n• In this case,\n• Income = 5,600 wons\n• Expenditure = 700 M + 1,400 S\n• So, 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• To draw it in a 2-D plane,\n➢5600 = 700M + 1400S\n➢700M = 5600 – 1400S\n➢M = 8 – 2S\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• The slope of the budget constraint is \ndetermined by the relative price. \n• Relative price - How many meal \ntickets would Pepe have to give up to \nget one more shirt, while staying \nwithin his budget?\n• All along the budget set, getting 1 \nshirt means giving up 2 meal tickets.\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Economists call it opportunity cost.\n• Opportunity cost indicate what have to be given up to obtain something. In other words, opportunity cost \nis the value of the next best alternative.\n• For Pepe, the opportunity cost of 1 shirt is the 2 meal tickets. \n• He would decide to buy one more shirt, If the value of the extra shirt exceed the value of the alternative \n(2 meal tickets).\n1. Budget Constraint\n• A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost.\n• If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost might be the time which would be spent \nto make up the class.\n• If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. \n• In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price.\n• For example, attending graduate school is the case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. \nThe explicit costs of attending college might be about tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. \nBut in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a \npaying job. Thus, graduate school imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost \nearnings.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if the price of a good changes?\n• Suppose that, the price of bus ticket increased to 1,400 won.\n• A price increase for bus tickets would have no effect on the ability to purchase Ramen. \n• But it would reduce the number of bus tickets which Pepe could afford to buy.\n• What happens in the budget constraint? Redraw it. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if Pepe’s income changes?\n• Suppose that, his income drops as a half(=2,800 won).\n• In this case, it would reduce the number of both of meal tickets and shirts which Pepe could afford to buy. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n4\n2\n1. Budget Constraint\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n2. Utility\n• People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility from using those goods and services.\n• Utility is the term which economists use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction/usefulness or \nhappiness with his or her choices.\n• Of course, in our daily life, we don’t measure such a thing. But, in model, it can be a quite useful \ninstrument to replicate the underlying incentive structure of each individuals.\n2. Utility\nEconomists assume the feature of utility\n1.The more of some good one consumes, the more utility \none obtains.\n2. As a person consumes more of a good, the additional (or \nmarginal) utility from each additional unit of the good \ndeclines.\n2. Utility\n• It is a general pattern that consumption of the first few units of good tends to bring a higher level of \nutility than consumption of later units.\n• Suppose that you are in thirsty. You can compare the degree to which the first few drops of water relieve \nthe thirst and the extent to which the drinking water later resolves the thirst.\n• Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility.\n• It means that, the utility of a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more \nthan the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.\n2. Utility\n• The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing \nchoices. \n• Most of people would not say, “My favorite food is potato, so I will eat nothing but only potatoes from \nnow on.”\n• Even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the marginal \nutility from those last few servings would not be very high. \n2. Utility\n• An example for the marginal utilities for meal ticket (and shirt):\n𝑀𝑈𝑀 = 1\n𝑀\n𝑀𝑈𝑆 = 1\n𝑆\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n• The marginal approach is based on looking at the tradeoffs(measured in terms of marginal utility per \nspending) of consuming less of one good and more of another.\n• Marginal utility of X = additional utility from consuming 1 more unit (the smallest unit we can imagine) \nof X\n• Which decision is better? Check the marginal utilities.\n• But we have to consider that the prices are different.\n• Relative price indicates how much unit of Y can be exchanged with 1 more X.\n• Marginal utility per spending of X = marginal utility of X / price of X\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 1\n• Which decision is better? Comparing the marginal utilities per spending.\n• Suppose an initial state of X,Y . What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n>\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ? Can he/she better off (by changing in decision for \nX,Y)? Yes.

In the short run, we can classify the \ncosts into fixed costs and variable costs.\n◦ Fixed costs are the costs that cannot be changed in the short run.\n◦ Variable costs are the costs that can be changed.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of \nproduction, at least not in the short term.\n◦ For example, the cost of building factory or buying heavy equipment, research and \ndevelopment costs, advertising expenses. \n◦ The level of fixed costs varies according to the feature of the products or \nindustry. \n◦ For instance, manufacturing mobile phone or computer chips requires an \nexpensive factory. But, a food-truck or a painting artist can get by with \nrelatively less fixed costs.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Variable costs are incurred in the act of producing.\n◦ For example, wages and cost to buy intermediate goods are variable costs.\n◦ The more you produce, the greater the variable cost.\n◦ Total cost = fixed cost + variable cost.\nThe nature of production\n◦ Two assumptions:\n1. Positivity (with respect to input)\n2. Law of diminishing marginal production\n◦ Marginal product of any input : the additional quantity of output obtained \nfrom one additional unit of that input.\nExample : Pepe’s chicken house\n◦ Assume that the fixed costs of operating the chicken house, including the space and \nequipment, are 100.\n◦ The variable costs are the costs of hiring worker, which in our example is 50 per deliver. \n◦ Variable cost :  price of input  x  quantity of input.\n◦ When one unit of the input (worker) is added, the cost would be increased as much as the \nprice of the input (50 for the wage).\n\nExample : cost structure of the \nchicken house\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\n1 10\n2 18\n3 24\n4 28\n5 30\n6 31\n7 31.5\nThe law of diminishing marginal \nproduction\n\nExample : revenue of the chicken \nhouse\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nToral revenue Additional rev \n(from 1 more \nworker)\n1 10 300 300\n2 18 540 240\n3 24 720 180\n4 28 840 120\n5 30 900 60\n6 31 930 30\n7 31.5 945 15\nLet’s assume the \nprice of 1 chicken \n= 30!\nExample : cost structure of the \nchicken house\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nFixed cost Variable \ncost\nTotal cost Additional cost \n(1 worker)\n1 10 100 50 150 50\n2 18 100 100 200 50\n3 24 100 150 250 50\n4 28 100 200 300 50\n5 30 100 250 350 50\n6 31 100 300 400 50\n7 31.5 100 350 450 50\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nAdditional cost \n(1 worker)\nAdditional rev \n(1 worker)\n1 10 50 300\n2 18 50 240\n3 24 50 180\n4 28 50 120\n5 30 50 60\n6 31 50 30\n7 31.5 50 15\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nAdditional cost \n(1 worker)\nAdditional rev \n(1 worker)\n1 10 50 300\n2 18 50 240\n3 24 50 180\n4 28 50 120\n5 30 50 60\n6 31 50 30\n7 31.5 50 15\nMR = MC\nThe production function\n◦ We've discussed about the production cost, by using a \nproduction table.\n◦ Now, we can use the production function instead of the \nproduction table.\n◦ And then, from the production function, we can derive of each \ncost functions.\nThe production function\n◦ As the utility function, the form of the production function is \nusually assumed.\n◦ In our case, I assume a production function with the pattern of \ndiminishing marginal product.\n◦ Because this form is one of the basic form of production \nfunction which economists usually uses.\n• Functions and graphs\n• The concept of differentiation\n• Formulas for differentiation\nPreparations\n• Function : a special type of relation between X and Y .

Demand curve\nDemand the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able \nto purchase at each price. \nDemand for each good and services can be obtained by individual consumer’s \npreference and their budgets.\nDemand represent the amount of wiliness to pay of the society. \n1. Demand curve\nThe total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity \ndemanded. \nSo, In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. \nDemand is mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities \ndemanded at those prices.\n1. Demand curve\nP         Q\nP         Q \nEconomists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity \ndemanded the law of demand. \nThe law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand are \nheld constant.\n1. Demand curve\nQ\nP\n1. Demand curve\nDemand curves can somewhat different for each product. \nThey may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. \nNearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope \ndown from left to right. \n2. Supply curve\nQuantity supplied means the amount of some good or service a producer is \nwilling to supply at each price. \nPrice is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. \nA rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of \nthat good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied.\n2. Supply curve\nQ\nP\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n18000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nWhat will be happened in next?\nSome chicken houses can not sell their chickens. So, Raw chickens, oils, flours \nat their storages starts to go bad.\nSome chicken houses will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a \nlower price than not to sell at all. \nSo, if the price is above the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to fall toward the equilibrium.\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n12000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nConsumers always are waiting their order and chicken houses says that they \nare filled with orders and there are no more stock of raw meats.\nIt’s not difficult for chicken houses to realize that even if they raise the price, \nthey can sell their stock out.\nSo, if the price is below the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to rise toward the equilibrium.\n4. Equilibrium\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nQ* = 1000\nP*\n=15000\nE\nE’\n4. Equilibrium\nThe word “equilibrium” means “balance.” \nIf a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason to \nmove away from that point. \nHowever, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise to \nmove the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.\n4. Equilibrium\nIn 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether \nsupply or demand determined a price was like arguing\n“whether it is the upper or the \nunder blade of a pair of \nscissors that cuts a piece of \npaper.” \n\n5. Shift of demand curve\nPrice, however, is not the only thing that influences demand and supply.\nWhat if overall consumer’s income has changed? \nSometime preferences can be suddenly changed.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \n5. Shift of demand curve\nQ\nP\nD0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nD1\nD2\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDoes the higher income always bring greater demand?\nA product whose demand rises when income rises is called a normal good.\nbut, there is a few exceptions to this pattern do exist. \nA product whose demand falls when income rises is called an inferior good. \n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnd, for some goods such as luxury cars, fine cuisines, or jewelry, the effect of \na rise in income can be especially pronounced.\nWe called those luxury goods.\nA luxury good is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally \nas income rises, \n5. Shift of demand curve\nOf course, income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand.\nWe can think about some of other factors that shift demand curves.\nOne of those is changing tastes or preferences.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \nIt might cause a severe avoiding to eat chickens.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDemographic changes can also be a important factor.\nActually, the demographic changes is combined with the changes in preference.\nSince the consumption preference of youth and old person is quite different, \nchanges in the demographic structure directly affects the overall preference of \nthe society.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnother example is the housing demand.\nSince the demand for owning houses is usually peaked in the middle age about \n40s, the overall housing demand can also be peaked, when the number of \nmiddle-aged in the country is the highest level.\nSome economists have tried to predict the future housing prices by using \npredictable demographic changes.\nMankiw, N. G., & Weil, D. N. (1989). The baby boom, the baby bust, and the \nhousing market. Regional science and urban economics, 19(2), 235-258.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nIt is also true that expectations about the future price (or expectations about \ntastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand.\nFor example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the \nstore to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. \nThese changes can push the demand curve to the right.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nOne interest thing is that some goods can be seriously affected by the \nexpectation.\nFor example, we can think about housing market.\nDemand for housing is not only determined  by preferences, but also by the \nexpectations for capital gain.\nThis feature of housing markets sometimes causes speculations in housing \nmarkets.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nHow about the supply curves? \nOne of most important factor affecting the supply curve might be the \nproduction cost.\nIf a firm faces lower costs of production, a firm’s profits go up. This can be \nshown by the supply curve shifting to the right.\nif a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any \ngiven selling price for its products. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the \nleft.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nQ\nP\nS0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nS1 S2\n6. Shift of supply curve\nSeveral other things affect the cost of production, too. \nWe can think about new technologies for production, and some government \npolicies.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nWhen producers develops or discovers a technology that allows the firm to \nproduce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right, as well. \nThink about the cost of raising a chicken in chicken farm and the poultry \nfactory system.\n\n6. Shift of supply curve\nGovernment policies also can affect the cost of production and the supply \ncurve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies.\nA subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces the \nfirm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. \nFrom the firm’s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of \nproduction that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower \nquantity at every given price. \nSo, government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at \nevery given price, shifting supply to the right.\n7. Price controls\nIn some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on politicians\n\n7. Price controls\nLaws that government enacts to regulate prices are called Price controls.\nPrice controls come in two ways.\nA price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level.\nAnd, a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n18000\n15000 E0\nE1\n1200\n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE2\n1500\n7. Price controls\nA price floor is the lowest legal price that can be paid in the market.\nPrice floors are sometimes called price supports. \nBecause they support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE’\n1500\nE\n7. Price controls\nThe demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the \nincentives provided by these laws to control prices.\nAs a result, It will often lead to undesirable consequences. \nIt implies alternative policy tools can often achieve the desired goals of price \ncontrol laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs."

Maximization of the objective under the constraint (rationality)\n2. Maximization of the utility subject to the budget constraint\n•  Marginal analysis\n3.  Derivation of a demand curve\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Suppose there is a consumer whose name is Pepe. He is the representative agent of all customers in our \nsociety.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• We want to capture that consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and \nwant.\n• Pepe has 5,600 wons in spending money each week.\n• He can allocate this spending between meal ticket and shirts. \n• The meal tickets cost 700 wons each, and the shirts are 1,400 wons each.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Of course, the budget constraint diagram containing just two goods is not realistic. \n• Because, in a modern economy, people choose from thousands of goods.\n• However, thinking about a model with many goods can be just a straightforward extension of what we \ndiscussed here.\n• The point is that there is always a trade-off problem in decisions.\n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket\n8\n4\n• Each point on the line of \nbudget constraint \nrepresents a combination \nof meal tickets and shirts, \nwhich the total cost adds \nup to Pepe’s budget of \n5,600 won. \nClothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• If he spend out his budget, we can \nthink his budget constraint is actually \nthe outer line of the colored area.\n• If he had unlimited income or goods \nwere free, then he could consume \nwithout limit.  \n• Any point outside the constraint is \nnot affordable, because it would cost \nmore money than Pepe has in his \nbudget.\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• It just means that,\n𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒.\n• In this case,\n• Income = 5,600 wons\n• Expenditure = 700 M + 1,400 S\n• So, 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• To draw it in a 2-D plane,\n➢5600 = 700M + 1400S\n➢700M = 5600 – 1400S\n➢M = 8 – 2S\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• The slope of the budget constraint is \ndetermined by the relative price. \n• Relative price - How many meal \ntickets would Pepe have to give up to \nget one more shirt, while staying \nwithin his budget?\n• All along the budget set, getting 1 \nshirt means giving up 2 meal tickets.\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Economists call it opportunity cost.\n• Opportunity cost indicate what have to be given up to obtain something. In other words, opportunity cost \nis the value of the next best alternative.\n• For Pepe, the opportunity cost of 1 shirt is the 2 meal tickets. \n• He would decide to buy one more shirt, If the value of the extra shirt exceed the value of the alternative \n(2 meal tickets).\n1. Budget Constraint\n• A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost.\n• If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost might be the time which would be spent \nto make up the class.\n• If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. \n• In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price.\n• For example, attending graduate school is the case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. \nThe explicit costs of attending college might be about tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. \nBut in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a \npaying job. Thus, graduate school imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost \nearnings.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if the price of a good changes?\n• Suppose that, the price of bus ticket increased to 1,400 won.\n• A price increase for bus tickets would have no effect on the ability to purchase Ramen. \n• But it would reduce the number of bus tickets which Pepe could afford to buy.\n• What happens in the budget constraint? Redraw it. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if Pepe’s income changes?\n• Suppose that, his income drops as a half(=2,800 won).\n• In this case, it would reduce the number of both of meal tickets and shirts which Pepe could afford to buy. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n4\n2\n1. Budget Constraint\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n2. Utility\n• People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility from using those goods and services.\n• Utility is the term which economists use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction/usefulness or \nhappiness with his or her choices.\n• Of course, in our daily life, we don’t measure such a thing. But, in model, it can be a quite useful \ninstrument to replicate the underlying incentive structure of each individuals.\n2. Utility\nEconomists assume the feature of utility\n1.The more of some good one consumes, the more utility \none obtains.\n2. As a person consumes more of a good, the additional (or \nmarginal) utility from each additional unit of the good \ndeclines.\n2. Utility\n• It is a general pattern that consumption of the first few units of good tends to bring a higher level of \nutility than consumption of later units.\n• Suppose that you are in thirsty. You can compare the degree to which the first few drops of water relieve \nthe thirst and the extent to which the drinking water later resolves the thirst.\n• Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility.\n• It means that, the utility of a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more \nthan the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.\n2. Utility\n• The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing \nchoices. \n• Most of people would not say, “My favorite food is potato, so I will eat nothing but only potatoes from \nnow on.”\n• Even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the marginal \nutility from those last few servings would not be very high. \n2. Utility\n• An example for the marginal utilities for meal ticket (and shirt):\n𝑀𝑈𝑀 = 1\n𝑀\n𝑀𝑈𝑆 = 1\n𝑆\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n• The marginal approach is based on looking at the tradeoffs(measured in terms of marginal utility per \nspending) of consuming less of one good and more of another.\n• Marginal utility of X = additional utility from consuming 1 more unit (the smallest unit we can imagine) \nof X\n• Which decision is better? Check the marginal utilities.\n• But we have to consider that the prices are different.\n• Relative price indicates how much unit of Y can be exchanged with 1 more X.\n• Marginal utility per spending of X = marginal utility of X / price of X\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 1\n• Which decision is better? Comparing the marginal utilities per spending.\n• Suppose an initial state of X,Y . What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ? Can he/she better off (by changing in decision for \nX,Y)? Yes. Suppose that he/she get more X by giving up some Y .\n• What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ?\n• After all adjustments, we derive the rule of maximization \n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\n• Note that there is no incentive to deviate from the equality condition.\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 2\n• Suppose that he/she starts to spend money from 0.\n• To make the best decision, he/she would choose the plan with a higher marginal utility per spending. For \nexample, if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n, he/she will choose X.\n• Note that the marginal utility of one good decreases as he/she consume more. If he/she consume X more \nand more, \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n. In that case, he/she can get more utility by getting more Y and giving up some X.\n• That means, if he/she is rational, he/she will stick to the condition,\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\nMarginal analysis\n: The rule of maximization\n• If there are other goods (which means, in more general terms),\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n= ⋯ =\n𝑴𝑼𝒁\n𝑷𝒁\n.\n• The rule of maximization captures several important characteristics of consumers in market economy.\n• The relationship among consumptions on different items.\n• The effect of price change\n• The effect of income change\n• How the shape of marginal utilities affect consumption plan (and how the consumption plan responses to income/price change)?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Budget constraint : 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nUtility function : 𝑀𝑈𝑀 = \n1\n𝑀, 𝑀𝑈𝑆 = \n1\n𝑆\n• What is the optimal choice for M, S?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Now, let’s suppose that the income goes up to 11,200 won.\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nIncome effect\n• Income effect and the characteristics of good\n• Normal goods : an increase in income causes an increase in demand (+)\n• Inferior goods : an increase in income causes a decrease in demand (-)\n• Luxury goods : an increase in income causes a bigger percentage increase in demand (++)\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• What if the price of M goes to 1400 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• If the price of S falls to 700 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 8 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n8\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• When a price changes,\n• Substitution effect : change in relative price (the slope in budget constraint)\n• Income effect (of a price change) : shift in real purchasing power\nPrice effect\n• Price effect : an increase in price causes an decrease in demand (-)\n* Special case : Giffen goods – price effect (+)\n• Relationship between goods\n• Substitute goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\n• Complementary goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• Then, consider price effect on other good\n• On substitute goods : an increase in the price of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• On complementary goods : an increase in the price of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\nDemand curve\n• What is demand curve?

In the short run, we can classify the \ncosts into fixed costs and variable costs.\n◦ Fixed costs are the costs that cannot be changed in the short run.\n◦ Variable costs are the costs that can be changed.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of \nproduction, at least not in the short term.\n◦ For example, the cost of building factory or buying heavy equipment, research and \ndevelopment costs, advertising expenses. \n◦ The level of fixed costs varies according to the feature of the products or \nindustry. \n◦ For instance, manufacturing mobile phone or computer chips requires an \nexpensive factory. But, a food-truck or a painting artist can get by with \nrelatively less fixed costs.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Variable costs are incurred in the act of producing.\n◦ For example, wages and cost to buy intermediate goods are variable costs.\n◦ The more you produce, the greater the variable cost.\n◦ Total cost = fixed cost + variable cost.\nThe nature of production\n◦ Two assumptions:\n1.

Introduction\nIn this week, we will learn about:\n- Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for \nGoods and Services\n-   Shifts in Demand and Supply curves\n- Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity\n- Price Ceilings and Price Floors\nMarket Equilibrium\nFirm\n1\nFirm\n2\nFirm\n3\nFirm\n4\nFirm\n5\nGood & \nservice \nmarket\nProduction \nfactor \nmarket\n1. Demand curve\nDemand the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able \nto purchase at each price. \nDemand for each good and services can be obtained by individual consumer’s \npreference and their budgets.\nDemand represent the amount of wiliness to pay of the society. \n1. Demand curve\nThe total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity \ndemanded. \nSo, In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. \nDemand is mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities \ndemanded at those prices.\n1. Demand curve\nP         Q\nP         Q \nEconomists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity \ndemanded the law of demand. \nThe law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand are \nheld constant.\n1. Demand curve\nQ\nP\n1. Demand curve\nDemand curves can somewhat different for each product. \nThey may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. \nNearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope \ndown from left to right. \n2. Supply curve\nQuantity supplied means the amount of some good or service a producer is \nwilling to supply at each price. \nPrice is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. \nA rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of \nthat good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied.\n2. Supply curve\nQ\nP\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n18000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nWhat will be happened in next?\nSome chicken houses can not sell their chickens. So, Raw chickens, oils, flours \nat their storages starts to go bad.\nSome chicken houses will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a \nlower price than not to sell at all. \nSo, if the price is above the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to fall toward the equilibrium.\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n12000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nConsumers always are waiting their order and chicken houses says that they \nare filled with orders and there are no more stock of raw meats.\nIt’s not difficult for chicken houses to realize that even if they raise the price, \nthey can sell their stock out.\nSo, if the price is below the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to rise toward the equilibrium.\n4. Equilibrium\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nQ* = 1000\nP*\n=15000\nE\nE’\n4. Equilibrium\nThe word “equilibrium” means “balance.” \nIf a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason to \nmove away from that point. \nHowever, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise to \nmove the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.\n4. Equilibrium\nIn 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether \nsupply or demand determined a price was like arguing\n“whether it is the upper or the \nunder blade of a pair of \nscissors that cuts a piece of \npaper.” \n5. Shift of demand curve\nPrice, however, is not the only thing that influences demand and supply.\nWhat if overall consumer’s income has changed? \nSometime preferences can be suddenly changed.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \n5. Shift of demand curve\nQ\nP\nD0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nD1\nD2\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDoes the higher income always bring greater demand?\nA product whose demand rises when income rises is called a normal good.\nbut, there is a few exceptions to this pattern do exist. \nA product whose demand falls when income rises is called an inferior good. \n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnd, for some goods such as luxury cars, fine cuisines, or jewelry, the effect of \na rise in income can be especially pronounced.\nWe called those luxury goods.\nA luxury good is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally \nas income rises, \n5. Shift of demand curve\nOf course, income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand.\nWe can think about some of other factors that shift demand curves.\nOne of those is changing tastes or preferences.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \nIt might cause a severe avoiding to eat chickens.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDemographic changes can also be a important factor.\nActually, the demographic changes is combined with the changes in preference.\nSince the consumption preference of youth and old person is quite different, \nchanges in the demographic structure directly affects the overall preference of \nthe society.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnother example is the housing demand.\nSince the demand for owning houses is usually peaked in the middle age about \n40s, the overall housing demand can also be peaked, when the number of \nmiddle-aged in the country is the highest level.\nSome economists have tried to predict the future housing prices by using \npredictable demographic changes.\nMankiw, N. G., & Weil, D. N. (1989). The baby boom, the baby bust, and the \nhousing market. Regional science and urban economics, 19(2), 235-258.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nIt is also true that expectations about the future price (or expectations about \ntastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand.\nFor example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the \nstore to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. \nThese changes can push the demand curve to the right.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nOne interest thing is that some goods can be seriously affected by the \nexpectation.\nFor example, we can think about housing market.\nDemand for housing is not only determined  by preferences, but also by the \nexpectations for capital gain.\nThis feature of housing markets sometimes causes speculations in housing \nmarkets.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nHow about the supply curves? \nOne of most important factor affecting the supply curve might be the \nproduction cost.\nIf a firm faces lower costs of production, a firm’s profits go up. This can be \nshown by the supply curve shifting to the right.\nif a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any \ngiven selling price for its products. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the \nleft.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nQ\nP\nS0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nS1 S2\n6. Shift of supply curve\nSeveral other things affect the cost of production, too. \nWe can think about new technologies for production, and some government \npolicies.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nWhen producers develops or discovers a technology that allows the firm to \nproduce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right, as well. \nThink about the cost of raising a chicken in chicken farm and the poultry \nfactory system.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nGovernment policies also can affect the cost of production and the supply \ncurve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies.\nA subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces the \nfirm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. \nFrom the firm’s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of \nproduction that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower \nquantity at every given price. \nSo, government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at \nevery given price, shifting supply to the right.\n7. Price controls\nIn some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on politicians\n7. Price controls\nLaws that government enacts to regulate prices are called Price controls.\nPrice controls come in two ways.\nA price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level.\nAnd, a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n18000\n15000 E0\nE1\n1200\n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE2\n1500\n7. Price controls\nA price floor is the lowest legal price that can be paid in the market.\nPrice floors are sometimes called price supports. \nBecause they support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE’\n1500\nE\n7. Price controls\nThe demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the \nincentives provided by these laws to control prices.\nAs a result, It will often lead to undesirable consequences. \nIt implies alternative policy tools can often achieve the desired goals of price \ncontrol laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs."

Model description \n•  What they can choose? Budget constraint\n•  What is their objective? Utility function\n•  How do they behave? Maximization of the objective under the constraint (rationality)\n2. Maximization of the utility subject to the budget constraint\n•  Marginal analysis\n3.  Derivation of a demand curve\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Suppose there is a consumer whose name is Pepe. He is the representative agent of all customers in our \nsociety.\n\n1. Budget Constraint\n• We want to capture that consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and \nwant.\n• Pepe has 5,600 wons in spending money each week.\n• He can allocate this spending between meal ticket and shirts. \n• The meal tickets cost 700 wons each, and the shirts are 1,400 wons each.\n\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Of course, the budget constraint diagram containing just two goods is not realistic. \n• Because, in a modern economy, people choose from thousands of goods.\n• However, thinking about a model with many goods can be just a straightforward extension of what we \ndiscussed here.\n• The point is that there is always a trade-off problem in decisions.\n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket\n8\n4\n• Each point on the line of \nbudget constraint \nrepresents a combination \nof meal tickets and shirts, \nwhich the total cost adds \nup to Pepe’s budget of \n5,600 won. \nClothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• If he spend out his budget, we can \nthink his budget constraint is actually \nthe outer line of the colored area.\n• If he had unlimited income or goods \nwere free, then he could consume \nwithout limit.  \n• Any point outside the constraint is \nnot affordable, because it would cost \nmore money than Pepe has in his \nbudget.\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• It just means that,\n𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒.\n• In this case,\n• Income = 5,600 wons\n• Expenditure = 700 M + 1,400 S\n• So, 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• To draw it in a 2-D plane,\n➢5600 = 700M + 1400S\n➢700M = 5600 – 1400S\n➢M = 8 – 2S\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• The slope of the budget constraint is \ndetermined by the relative price. \n• Relative price - How many meal \ntickets would Pepe have to give up to \nget one more shirt, while staying \nwithin his budget?\n• All along the budget set, getting 1 \nshirt means giving up 2 meal tickets.\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Economists call it opportunity cost.\n• Opportunity cost indicate what have to be given up to obtain something. In other words, opportunity cost \nis the value of the next best alternative.\n• For Pepe, the opportunity cost of 1 shirt is the 2 meal tickets. \n• He would decide to buy one more shirt, If the value of the extra shirt exceed the value of the alternative \n(2 meal tickets).\n1. Budget Constraint\n• A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost.\n• If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost might be the time which would be spent \nto make up the class.\n• If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. \n• In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price.\n• For example, attending graduate school is the case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. \nThe explicit costs of attending college might be about tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. \nBut in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a \npaying job. Thus, graduate school imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost \nearnings.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if the price of a good changes?\n• Suppose that, the price of bus ticket increased to 1,400 won.\n• A price increase for bus tickets would have no effect on the ability to purchase Ramen. \n• But it would reduce the number of bus tickets which Pepe could afford to buy.\n• What happens in the budget constraint? Redraw it. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if Pepe’s income changes?\n• Suppose that, his income drops as a half(=2,800 won).\n• In this case, it would reduce the number of both of meal tickets and shirts which Pepe could afford to buy. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n4\n2\n1. Budget Constraint\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n2. Utility\n• People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility from using those goods and services.\n• Utility is the term which economists use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction/usefulness or \nhappiness with his or her choices.\n• Of course, in our daily life, we don’t measure such a thing. But, in model, it can be a quite useful \ninstrument to replicate the underlying incentive structure of each individuals.\n2. Utility\nEconomists assume the feature of utility\n1.The more of some good one consumes, the more utility \none obtains.\n2. As a person consumes more of a good, the additional (or \nmarginal) utility from each additional unit of the good \ndeclines.\n2. Utility\n• It is a general pattern that consumption of the first few units of good tends to bring a higher level of \nutility than consumption of later units.\n• Suppose that you are in thirsty. You can compare the degree to which the first few drops of water relieve \nthe thirst and the extent to which the drinking water later resolves the thirst.\n• Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility.\n• It means that, the utility of a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more \nthan the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.\n2. Utility\n• The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing \nchoices. \n• Most of people would not say, “My favorite food is potato, so I will eat nothing but only potatoes from \nnow on.”\n• Even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the marginal \nutility from those last few servings would not be very high. \n2. Utility\n• An example for the marginal utilities for meal ticket (and shirt):\n𝑀𝑈𝑀 = 1\n𝑀\n𝑀𝑈𝑆 = 1\n𝑆\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n• The marginal approach is based on looking at the tradeoffs(measured in terms of marginal utility per \nspending) of consuming less of one good and more of another.\n• Marginal utility of X = additional utility from consuming 1 more unit (the smallest unit we can imagine) \nof X\n• Which decision is better? Check the marginal utilities.\n• But we have to consider that the prices are different.\n• Relative price indicates how much unit of Y can be exchanged with 1 more X.\n• Marginal utility per spending of X = marginal utility of X / price of X\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 1\n• Which decision is better? Comparing the marginal utilities per spending.\n• Suppose an initial state of X,Y . What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n>\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ? Can he/she better off (by changing in decision for \nX,Y)? Yes. Suppose that he/she get more X by giving up some Y . \n• What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n<\n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ?\n• After all adjustments, we derive the rule of maximization \n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\n• Note that there is no incentive to deviate from the equality condition.\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 2\n• Suppose that he/she starts to spend money from 0.\n• To make the best decision, he/she would choose the plan with a higher marginal utility per spending.

In the short run, we can classify the \ncosts into fixed costs and variable costs.\n◦ Fixed costs are the costs that cannot be changed in the short run.\n◦ Variable costs are the costs that can be changed.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of \nproduction, at least not in the short term.\n◦ For example, the cost of building factory or buying heavy equipment, research and \ndevelopment costs, advertising expenses. \n◦ The level of fixed costs varies according to the feature of the products or \nindustry. \n◦ For instance, manufacturing mobile phone or computer chips requires an \nexpensive factory. But, a food-truck or a painting artist can get by with \nrelatively less fixed costs.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Variable costs are incurred in the act of producing.\n◦ For example, wages and cost to buy intermediate goods are variable costs.\n◦ The more you produce, the greater the variable cost.\n◦ Total cost = fixed cost + variable cost.\nThe nature of production\n◦ Two assumptions:\n1. Positivity (with respect to input)\n2. Law of diminishing marginal production\n◦ Marginal product of any input : the additional quantity of output obtained \nfrom one additional unit of that input.\nExample : Pepe’s chicken house\n◦ Assume that the fixed costs of operating the chicken house, including the space and \nequipment, are 100.\n◦ The variable costs are the costs of hiring worker, which in our example is 50 per deliver. \n◦ Variable cost :  price of input  x  quantity of input.\n◦ When one unit of the input (worker) is added, the cost would be increased as much as the \nprice of the input (50 for the wage).\n\nExample : cost structure of the \nchicken house\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\n1 10\n2 18\n3 24\n4 28\n5 30\n6 31\n7 31.5\nThe law of diminishing marginal \nproduction\n\nExample : revenue of the chicken \nhouse\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nToral revenue Additional rev \n(from 1 more \nworker)\n1 10 300 300\n2 18 540 240\n3 24 720 180\n4 28 840 120\n5 30 900 60\n6 31 930 30\n7 31.5 945 15\nLet’s assume the \nprice of 1 chicken \n= 30!\nExample : cost structure of the \nchicken house\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nFixed cost Variable \ncost\nTotal cost Additional cost \n(1 worker)\n1 10 100 50 150 50\n2 18 100 100 200 50\n3 24 100 150 250 50\n4 28 100 200 300 50\n5 30 100 250 350 50\n6 31 100 300 400 50\n7 31.5 100 350 450 50\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nAdditional cost \n(1 worker)\nAdditional rev \n(1 worker)\n1 10 50 300\n2 18 50 240\n3 24 50 180\n4 28 50 120\n5 30 50 60\n6 31 50 30\n7 31.5 50 15\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nAdditional cost \n(1 worker)\nAdditional rev \n(1 worker)\n1 10 50 300\n2 18 50 240\n3 24 50 180\n4 28 50 120\n5 30 50 60\n6 31 50 30\n7 31.5 50 15\nMR = MC\nThe production function\n◦ We've discussed about the production cost, by using a \nproduction table.\n◦ Now, we can use the production function instead of the \nproduction table.\n◦ And then, from the production function, we can derive of each \ncost functions.\nThe production function\n◦ As the utility function, the form of the production function is \nusually assumed.\n◦ In our case, I assume a production function with the pattern of \ndiminishing marginal product.\n◦ Because this form is one of the basic form of production \nfunction which economists usually uses.\n• Functions and graphs\n• The concept of differentiation\n• Formulas for differentiation\nPreparations\n• Function : a special type of relation between X and Y .

Demand curve\nDemand the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able \nto purchase at each price. \nDemand for each good and services can be obtained by individual consumer’s \npreference and their budgets.\nDemand represent the amount of wiliness to pay of the society. \n1. Demand curve\nThe total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity \ndemanded. \nSo, In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. \nDemand is mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities \ndemanded at those prices.\n1. Demand curve\nP         Q\nP         Q \nEconomists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity \ndemanded the law of demand. \nThe law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand are \nheld constant.\n1. Demand curve\nQ\nP\n1. Demand curve\nDemand curves can somewhat different for each product. \nThey may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. \nNearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope \ndown from left to right. \n2. Supply curve\nQuantity supplied means the amount of some good or service a producer is \nwilling to supply at each price. \nPrice is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. \nA rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of \nthat good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied.\n2. Supply curve\nQ\nP\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n18000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nWhat will be happened in next?\nSome chicken houses can not sell their chickens. So, Raw chickens, oils, flours \nat their storages starts to go bad.\nSome chicken houses will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a \nlower price than not to sell at all. \nSo, if the price is above the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to fall toward the equilibrium.\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n12000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nConsumers always are waiting their order and chicken houses says that they \nare filled with orders and there are no more stock of raw meats.\nIt’s not difficult for chicken houses to realize that even if they raise the price, \nthey can sell their stock out.\nSo, if the price is below the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to rise toward the equilibrium.\n4. Equilibrium\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nQ* = 1000\nP*\n=15000\nE\nE’\n4. Equilibrium\nThe word “equilibrium” means “balance.” \nIf a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason to \nmove away from that point. \nHowever, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise to \nmove the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.\n4. Equilibrium\nIn 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether \nsupply or demand determined a price was like arguing\n“whether it is the upper or the \nunder blade of a pair of \nscissors that cuts a piece of \npaper.” \n\n5. Shift of demand curve\nPrice, however, is not the only thing that influences demand and supply.\nWhat if overall consumer’s income has changed? \nSometime preferences can be suddenly changed.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \n5. Shift of demand curve\nQ\nP\nD0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nD1\nD2\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDoes the higher income always bring greater demand?\nA product whose demand rises when income rises is called a normal good.\nbut, there is a few exceptions to this pattern do exist. \nA product whose demand falls when income rises is called an inferior good. \n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnd, for some goods such as luxury cars, fine cuisines, or jewelry, the effect of \na rise in income can be especially pronounced.\nWe called those luxury goods.\nA luxury good is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally \nas income rises, \n5. Shift of demand curve\nOf course, income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand.\nWe can think about some of other factors that shift demand curves.\nOne of those is changing tastes or preferences.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \nIt might cause a severe avoiding to eat chickens.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDemographic changes can also be a important factor.\nActually, the demographic changes is combined with the changes in preference.\nSince the consumption preference of youth and old person is quite different, \nchanges in the demographic structure directly affects the overall preference of \nthe society.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnother example is the housing demand.\nSince the demand for owning houses is usually peaked in the middle age about \n40s, the overall housing demand can also be peaked, when the number of \nmiddle-aged in the country is the highest level.\nSome economists have tried to predict the future housing prices by using \npredictable demographic changes.\nMankiw, N. G., & Weil, D. N. (1989). The baby boom, the baby bust, and the \nhousing market. Regional science and urban economics, 19(2), 235-258.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nIt is also true that expectations about the future price (or expectations about \ntastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand.\nFor example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the \nstore to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. \nThese changes can push the demand curve to the right.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nOne interest thing is that some goods can be seriously affected by the \nexpectation.\nFor example, we can think about housing market.\nDemand for housing is not only determined  by preferences, but also by the \nexpectations for capital gain.\nThis feature of housing markets sometimes causes speculations in housing \nmarkets.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nHow about the supply curves? \nOne of most important factor affecting the supply curve might be the \nproduction cost.\nIf a firm faces lower costs of production, a firm’s profits go up. This can be \nshown by the supply curve shifting to the right.\nif a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any \ngiven selling price for its products. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the \nleft.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nQ\nP\nS0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nS1 S2\n6. Shift of supply curve\nSeveral other things affect the cost of production, too. \nWe can think about new technologies for production, and some government \npolicies.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nWhen producers develops or discovers a technology that allows the firm to \nproduce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right, as well. \nThink about the cost of raising a chicken in chicken farm and the poultry \nfactory system.\n\n6. Shift of supply curve\nGovernment policies also can affect the cost of production and the supply \ncurve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies.\nA subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces the \nfirm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. \nFrom the firm’s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of \nproduction that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower \nquantity at every given price. \nSo, government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at \nevery given price, shifting supply to the right.\n7. Price controls\nIn some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on politicians\n\n7. Price controls\nLaws that government enacts to regulate prices are called Price controls.\nPrice controls come in two ways.\nA price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level.\nAnd, a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n18000\n15000 E0\nE1\n1200\n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE2\n1500\n7. Price controls\nA price floor is the lowest legal price that can be paid in the market.\nPrice floors are sometimes called price supports. \nBecause they support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE’\n1500\nE\n7. Price controls\nThe demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the \nincentives provided by these laws to control prices.\nAs a result, It will often lead to undesirable consequences. \nIt implies alternative policy tools can often achieve the desired goals of price \ncontrol laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs."

Maximization of the objective under the constraint (rationality)\n2. Maximization of the utility subject to the budget constraint\n•  Marginal analysis\n3.  Derivation of a demand curve\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Suppose there is a consumer whose name is Pepe. He is the representative agent of all customers in our \nsociety.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• We want to capture that consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and \nwant.\n• Pepe has 5,600 wons in spending money each week.\n• He can allocate this spending between meal ticket and shirts. \n• The meal tickets cost 700 wons each, and the shirts are 1,400 wons each.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Of course, the budget constraint diagram containing just two goods is not realistic. \n• Because, in a modern economy, people choose from thousands of goods.\n• However, thinking about a model with many goods can be just a straightforward extension of what we \ndiscussed here.\n• The point is that there is always a trade-off problem in decisions.\n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket\n8\n4\n• Each point on the line of \nbudget constraint \nrepresents a combination \nof meal tickets and shirts, \nwhich the total cost adds \nup to Pepe’s budget of \n5,600 won. \nClothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• If he spend out his budget, we can \nthink his budget constraint is actually \nthe outer line of the colored area.\n• If he had unlimited income or goods \nwere free, then he could consume \nwithout limit.  \n• Any point outside the constraint is \nnot affordable, because it would cost \nmore money than Pepe has in his \nbudget.\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• It just means that,\n𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒.\n• In this case,\n• Income = 5,600 wons\n• Expenditure = 700 M + 1,400 S\n• So, 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• To draw it in a 2-D plane,\n➢5600 = 700M + 1400S\n➢700M = 5600 – 1400S\n➢M = 8 – 2S\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• The slope of the budget constraint is \ndetermined by the relative price. \n• Relative price - How many meal \ntickets would Pepe have to give up to \nget one more shirt, while staying \nwithin his budget?\n• All along the budget set, getting 1 \nshirt means giving up 2 meal tickets.\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Economists call it opportunity cost.\n• Opportunity cost indicate what have to be given up to obtain something. In other words, opportunity cost \nis the value of the next best alternative.\n• For Pepe, the opportunity cost of 1 shirt is the 2 meal tickets. \n• He would decide to buy one more shirt, If the value of the extra shirt exceed the value of the alternative \n(2 meal tickets).\n1. Budget Constraint\n• A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost.\n• If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost might be the time which would be spent \nto make up the class.\n• If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. \n• In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price.\n• For example, attending graduate school is the case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. \nThe explicit costs of attending college might be about tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. \nBut in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a \npaying job. Thus, graduate school imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost \nearnings.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if the price of a good changes?\n• Suppose that, the price of bus ticket increased to 1,400 won.\n• A price increase for bus tickets would have no effect on the ability to purchase Ramen. \n• But it would reduce the number of bus tickets which Pepe could afford to buy.\n• What happens in the budget constraint? Redraw it. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if Pepe’s income changes?\n• Suppose that, his income drops as a half(=2,800 won).\n• In this case, it would reduce the number of both of meal tickets and shirts which Pepe could afford to buy. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n4\n2\n1. Budget Constraint\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n2. Utility\n• People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility from using those goods and services.\n• Utility is the term which economists use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction/usefulness or \nhappiness with his or her choices.\n• Of course, in our daily life, we don’t measure such a thing. But, in model, it can be a quite useful \ninstrument to replicate the underlying incentive structure of each individuals.\n2. Utility\nEconomists assume the feature of utility\n1.The more of some good one consumes, the more utility \none obtains.\n2. As a person consumes more of a good, the additional (or \nmarginal) utility from each additional unit of the good \ndeclines.\n2. Utility\n• It is a general pattern that consumption of the first few units of good tends to bring a higher level of \nutility than consumption of later units.\n• Suppose that you are in thirsty. You can compare the degree to which the first few drops of water relieve \nthe thirst and the extent to which the drinking water later resolves the thirst.\n• Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility.\n• It means that, the utility of a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more \nthan the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.\n2. Utility\n• The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing \nchoices. \n• Most of people would not say, “My favorite food is potato, so I will eat nothing but only potatoes from \nnow on.”\n• Even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the marginal \nutility from those last few servings would not be very high. \n2. Utility\n• An example for the marginal utilities for meal ticket (and shirt):\n𝑀𝑈𝑀 = 1\n𝑀\n𝑀𝑈𝑆 = 1\n𝑆\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n• The marginal approach is based on looking at the tradeoffs(measured in terms of marginal utility per \nspending) of consuming less of one good and more of another.\n• Marginal utility of X = additional utility from consuming 1 more unit (the smallest unit we can imagine) \nof X\n• Which decision is better? Check the marginal utilities.\n• But we have to consider that the prices are different.\n• Relative price indicates how much unit of Y can be exchanged with 1 more X.\n• Marginal utility per spending of X = marginal utility of X / price of X\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 1\n• Which decision is better? Comparing the marginal utilities per spending.\n• Suppose an initial state of X,Y . What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ? Can he/she better off (by changing in decision for \nX,Y)? Yes. Suppose that he/she get more X by giving up some Y .\n• What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ?\n• After all adjustments, we derive the rule of maximization \n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\n• Note that there is no incentive to deviate from the equality condition.\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 2\n• Suppose that he/she starts to spend money from 0.\n• To make the best decision, he/she would choose the plan with a higher marginal utility per spending. For \nexample, if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n, he/she will choose X.\n• Note that the marginal utility of one good decreases as he/she consume more. If he/she consume X more \nand more, \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n. In that case, he/she can get more utility by getting more Y and giving up some X.\n• That means, if he/she is rational, he/she will stick to the condition,\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\nMarginal analysis\n: The rule of maximization\n• If there are other goods (which means, in more general terms),\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n=\n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n= ⋯ =\n𝑴𝑼𝒁\n𝑷𝒁\n.\n• The rule of maximization captures several important characteristics of consumers in market economy.\n• The relationship among consumptions on different items.\n• The effect of price change\n• The effect of income change\n• How the shape of marginal utilities affect consumption plan (and how the consumption plan responses to income/price change)?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Budget constraint : 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nUtility function : 𝑀𝑈𝑀 = \n1\n𝑀, 𝑀𝑈𝑆 = \n1\n𝑆\n• What is the optimal choice for M, S?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• Now, let’s suppose that the income goes up to 11,200 won.\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nIncome effect\n• Income effect and the characteristics of good\n• Normal goods : an increase in income causes an increase in demand (+)\n• Inferior goods : an increase in income causes a decrease in demand (-)\n• Luxury goods : an increase in income causes a bigger percentage increase in demand (++)\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• What if the price of M goes to 1400 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• If the price of S falls to 700 won ?\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\nMeal ticket = 8 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n8\nExample : Pepe’s optimal choice\n• When a price changes,\n• Substitution effect : change in relative price (the slope in budget constraint)\n• Income effect (of a price change) : shift in real purchasing power\nPrice effect\n• Price effect : an increase in price causes an decrease in demand (-)\n* Special case : Giffen goods – price effect (+)\n• Relationship between goods\n• Substitute goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\n• Complementary goods : an increase in the demand of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• Then, consider price effect on other good\n• On substitute goods : an increase in the price of A causes an increase in the demand of B (+)\n• On complementary goods : an increase in the price of A causes an decrease in the demand of B (-)\nDemand curve\n• What is demand curve?

In the short run, we can classify the \ncosts into fixed costs and variable costs.\n◦ Fixed costs are the costs that cannot be changed in the short run.\n◦ Variable costs are the costs that can be changed.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of \nproduction, at least not in the short term.\n◦ For example, the cost of building factory or buying heavy equipment, research and \ndevelopment costs, advertising expenses. \n◦ The level of fixed costs varies according to the feature of the products or \nindustry. \n◦ For instance, manufacturing mobile phone or computer chips requires an \nexpensive factory. But, a food-truck or a painting artist can get by with \nrelatively less fixed costs.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Variable costs are incurred in the act of producing.\n◦ For example, wages and cost to buy intermediate goods are variable costs.\n◦ The more you produce, the greater the variable cost.\n◦ Total cost = fixed cost + variable cost.\nThe nature of production\n◦ Two assumptions:\n1. Positivity (with respect to input)\n2. Law of diminishing marginal production\n◦ Marginal product of any input : the additional quantity of output obtained \nfrom one additional unit of that input.\nExample : Pepe’s chicken house\n◦ Assume that the fixed costs of operating the chicken house, including the space and \nequipment, are 100.\n◦ The variable costs are the costs of hiring worker, which in our example is 50 per deliver. \n◦ Variable cost :  price of input  x  quantity of input.\n◦ When one unit of the input (worker) is added, the cost would be increased as much as the \nprice of the input (50 for the wage).\nExample : cost structure of the \nchicken house\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\n1 10\n2 18\n3 24\n4 28\n5 30\n6 31\n7 31.5\nThe law of diminishing marginal \nproduction\nExample : revenue of the chicken \nhouse\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nToral revenue Additional rev \n(from 1 more \nworker)\n1 10 300 300\n2 18 540 240\n3 24 720 180\n4 28 840 120\n5 30 900 60\n6 31 930 30\n7 31.5 945 15\nLet’s assume the \nprice of 1 chicken \n= 30!\nExample : cost structure of the \nchicken house\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nFixed cost Variable \ncost\nTotal cost Additional cost \n(1 worker)\n1 10 100 50 150 50\n2 18 100 100 200 50\n3 24 100 150 250 50\n4 28 100 200 300 50\n5 30 100 250 350 50\n6 31 100 300 400 50\n7 31.5 100 350 450 50\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nAdditional cost \n(1 worker)\nAdditional rev \n(1 worker)\n1 10 50 300\n2 18 50 240\n3 24 50 180\n4 28 50 120\n5 30 50 60\n6 31 50 30\n7 31.5 50 15\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nLabor Quantity \nproduced\nAdditional cost \n(1 worker)\nAdditional rev \n(1 worker)\n1 10 50 300\n2 18 50 240\n3 24 50 180\n4 28 50 120\n5 30 50 60\n6 31 50 30\n7 31.5 50 15\nMR = MC\nThe production function\n◦ We've discussed about the production cost, by using a \nproduction table.\n◦ Now, we can use the production function instead of the \nproduction table.\n◦ And then, from the production function, we can derive of each \ncost functions.\nThe production function\n◦ As the utility function, the form of the production function is \nusually assumed.\n◦ In our case, I assume a production function with the pattern of \ndiminishing marginal product.\n◦ Because this form is one of the basic form of production \nfunction which economists usually uses.\n• Functions and graphs\n• The concept of differentiation\n• Formulas for differentiation\nPreparations\n• Function : a special type of relation between X and Y .

Demand curve\nP         Q\nP         Q \nEconomists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity \ndemanded the law of demand. \nThe law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand are \nheld constant.\n1. Demand curve\nQ\nP\n1. Demand curve\nDemand curves can somewhat different for each product. \nThey may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. \nNearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope \ndown from left to right. \n2. Supply curve\nQuantity supplied means the amount of some good or service a producer is \nwilling to supply at each price. \nPrice is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. \nA rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of \nthat good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied.\n2. Supply curve\nQ\nP\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n18000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess supply\nWhat will be happened in next?\nSome chicken houses can not sell their chickens. So, Raw chickens, oils, flours \nat their storages starts to go bad.\nSome chicken houses will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a \nlower price than not to sell at all. \nSo, if the price is above the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to fall toward the equilibrium.\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nE\n800\n12000\n1200\n3. Disequilibrium – excess demand\nConsumers always are waiting their order and chicken houses says that they \nare filled with orders and there are no more stock of raw meats.\nIt’s not difficult for chicken houses to realize that even if they raise the price, \nthey can sell their stock out.\nSo, if the price is below the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure \nof demand and supply pressures for the price to rise toward the equilibrium.\n4. Equilibrium\nQ\nP\nDemand\nSupply\nQ* = 1000\nP*\n=15000\nE\nE’\n4. Equilibrium\nThe word “equilibrium” means “balance.” \nIf a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason to \nmove away from that point. \nHowever, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise to \nmove the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.\n4. Equilibrium\nIn 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether \nsupply or demand determined a price was like arguing\n“whether it is the upper or the \nunder blade of a pair of \nscissors that cuts a piece of \npaper.” \n5. Shift of demand curve\nPrice, however, is not the only thing that influences demand and supply.\nWhat if overall consumer’s income has changed? \nSometime preferences can be suddenly changed.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \n5. Shift of demand curve\nQ\nP\nD0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nD1\nD2\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDoes the higher income always bring greater demand?\nA product whose demand rises when income rises is called a normal good.\nbut, there is a few exceptions to this pattern do exist. \nA product whose demand falls when income rises is called an inferior good. \n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnd, for some goods such as luxury cars, fine cuisines, or jewelry, the effect of \na rise in income can be especially pronounced.\nWe called those luxury goods.\nA luxury good is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally \nas income rises, \n5. Shift of demand curve\nOf course, income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand.\nWe can think about some of other factors that shift demand curves.\nOne of those is changing tastes or preferences.\nFor example, if avian influenza has occurred, how is demand for chicken \naffected? \nIt might cause a severe avoiding to eat chickens.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nDemographic changes can also be a important factor.\nActually, the demographic changes is combined with the changes in preference.\nSince the consumption preference of youth and old person is quite different, \nchanges in the demographic structure directly affects the overall preference of \nthe society.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nAnother example is the housing demand.\nSince the demand for owning houses is usually peaked in the middle age about \n40s, the overall housing demand can also be peaked, when the number of \nmiddle-aged in the country is the highest level.\nSome economists have tried to predict the future housing prices by using \npredictable demographic changes.\nMankiw, N. G., & Weil, D. N. (1989). The baby boom, the baby bust, and the \nhousing market. Regional science and urban economics, 19(2), 235-258.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nIt is also true that expectations about the future price (or expectations about \ntastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand.\nFor example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the \nstore to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. \nThese changes can push the demand curve to the right.\n5. Shift of demand curve\nOne interest thing is that some goods can be seriously affected by the \nexpectation.\nFor example, we can think about housing market.\nDemand for housing is not only determined  by preferences, but also by the \nexpectations for capital gain.\nThis feature of housing markets sometimes causes speculations in housing \nmarkets.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nHow about the supply curves? \nOne of most important factor affecting the supply curve might be the \nproduction cost.\nIf a firm faces lower costs of production, a firm’s profits go up. This can be \nshown by the supply curve shifting to the right.\nif a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any \ngiven selling price for its products. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the \nleft.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nQ\nP\nS0\n1000\nE\n15000\n800\n18000\n1200\nS1 S2\n6. Shift of supply curve\nSeveral other things affect the cost of production, too. \nWe can think about new technologies for production, and some government \npolicies.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nWhen producers develops or discovers a technology that allows the firm to \nproduce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right, as well. \nThink about the cost of raising a chicken in chicken farm and the poultry \nfactory system.\n6. Shift of supply curve\nGovernment policies also can affect the cost of production and the supply \ncurve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies.\nA subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces the \nfirm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. \nFrom the firm’s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of \nproduction that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower \nquantity at every given price. \nSo, government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at \nevery given price, shifting supply to the right.\n7. Price controls\nIn some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on politicians\n7. Price controls\nLaws that government enacts to regulate prices are called Price controls.\nPrice controls come in two ways.\nA price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level.\nAnd, a price floor keeps a price from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n18000\n15000 E0\nE1\n1200\n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE2\n1500\n7. Price controls\nA price floor is the lowest legal price that can be paid in the market.\nPrice floors are sometimes called price supports. \nBecause they support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level. \n7. Price controls\nQ\nP\n1000\n15000\nE’\n1500\nE\n7. Price controls\nThe demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the \nincentives provided by these laws to control prices.\nAs a result, It will often lead to undesirable consequences. \nIt implies alternative policy tools can often achieve the desired goals of price \ncontrol laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs."
