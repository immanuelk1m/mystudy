In the short run, we can classify the \ncosts into fixed costs and variable costs.\n◦ Fixed costs are the costs that cannot be changed in the short run.\n◦ Variable costs are the costs that can be changed.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of \nproduction, at least not in the short term.\n◦ For example, the cost of building factory or buying heavy equipment, research and \ndevelopment costs, advertising expenses. \n◦ The level of fixed costs varies according to the feature of the products or \nindustry. \n◦ For instance, manufacturing mobile phone or computer chips requires an \nexpensive factory. But, a food-truck or a painting artist can get by with \nrelatively less fixed costs.\nThe structure of production cost\n◦ Variable costs are incurred in the act of producing.\n◦ For example, wages and cost to buy intermediate goods are variable costs.\n◦ The more you produce, the greater the variable cost.\n◦ Total cost = fixed cost + variable cost.\nThe nature of production\n◦ Two assumptions:\n1. Positivity (with respect to input)\n2. Law of diminishing marginal production\n◦ Marginal product of any input : the additional quantity of output obtained \nfrom one additional unit of that input.",
