        "1. Budget Constraint\n• Suppose there is a consumer whose name is Pepe. He is the representative agent of all customers in our \nsociety.\n\n1. Budget Constraint\n• We want to capture that consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and \nwant.\n• Pepe has 5,600 wons in spending money each week.\n• He can allocate this spending between meal ticket and shirts. \n• The meal tickets cost 700 wons each, and the shirts are 1,400 wons each.\n\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Of course, the budget constraint diagram containing just two goods is not realistic. \n• Because, in a modern economy, people choose from thousands of goods.\n• However, thinking about a model with many goods can be just a straightforward extension of what we \ndiscussed here.\n• The point is that there is always a trade-off problem in decisions.\n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket\n8\n4\n• Each point on the line of \nbudget constraint \nrepresents a combination \nof meal tickets and shirts, \nwhich the total cost adds \nup to Pepe’s budget of \n5,600 won. \nClothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• If he spend out his budget, we can \nthink his budget constraint is actually \nthe outer line of the colored area.\n• If he had unlimited income or goods \nwere free, then he could consume \nwithout limit.  \n• Any point outside the constraint is \nnot affordable, because it would cost \nmore money than Pepe has in his \nbudget.\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• It just means that,\n𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒.\n• In this case,\n• Income = 5,600 wons\n• Expenditure = 700 M + 1,400 S\n• So, 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• To draw it in a 2-D plane,\n➢5600 = 700M + 1400S\n➢700M = 5600 – 1400S\n➢M = 8 – 2S\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• The slope of the budget constraint is \ndetermined by the relative price. \n• Relative price - How many meal \ntickets would Pepe have to give up to \nget one more shirt, while staying \nwithin his budget?\n• All along the budget set, getting 1 \nshirt means giving up 2 meal tickets.\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Economists call it opportunity cost.\n• Opportunity cost indicate what have to be given up to obtain something. In other words, opportunity cost \nis the value of the next best alternative.\n• For Pepe, the opportunity cost of 1 shirt is the 2 meal tickets. \n• He would decide to buy one more shirt, If the value of the extra shirt exceed the value of the alternative \n(2 meal tickets).\n1. Budget Constraint\n• A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost.\n• If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost might be the time which would be spent \nto make up the class.\n• If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. \n• In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price.\n• For example, attending graduate school is the case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. \nThe explicit costs of attending college might be about tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. \nBut in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a \npaying job. Thus, graduate school imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost \nearnings.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if the price of a good changes?\n• Suppose that, the price of bus ticket increased to 1,400 won.\n• A price increase for bus tickets would have no effect on the ability to purchase Ramen. \n• But it would reduce the number of bus tickets which Pepe could afford to buy.\n• What happens in the budget constraint? Redraw it. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if Pepe’s income changes?\n• Suppose that, his income drops as a half(=2,800 won).\n• In this case, it would reduce the number of both of meal tickets and shirts which Pepe could afford to buy. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n4\n2\n1. Budget Constraint\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4",
        "2. Utility\n• People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility from using those goods and services.\n• Utility is the term which economists use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction/usefulness or \nhappiness with his or her choices.\n• Of course, in our daily life, we don’t measure such a thing. But, in model, it can be a quite useful \ninstrument to replicate the underlying incentive structure of each individuals.\n2. Utility\nEconomists assume the feature of utility\n1.The more of some good one consumes, the more utility \none obtains.\n2. As a person consumes more of a good, the additional (or \nmarginal) utility from each additional unit of the good \ndeclines.\n2. Utility\n• It is a general pattern that consumption of the first few units of good tends to bring a higher level of \nutility than consumption of later units.\n• Suppose that you are in thirsty. You can compare the degree to which the first few drops of water relieve \nthe thirst and the extent to which the drinking water later resolves the thirst.\n• Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility.\n• It means that, the utility of a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more \nthan the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.\n2. Utility\n• The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing \nchoices. \n• Most of people would not say, “My favorite food is potato, so I will eat nothing but only potatoes from \nnow on.”\n• Even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the marginal \nutility from those last few servings would not be very high. \n2. Utility\n• An example for the marginal utilities for meal ticket (and shirt):\n𝑀𝑈𝑀 = 1\n𝑀\n𝑀𝑈𝑆 = 1\n𝑆",
        "What is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n• The marginal approach is based on looking at the tradeoffs(measured in terms of marginal utility per \nspending) of consuming less of one good and more of another.\n• Marginal utility of X = additional utility from consuming 1 more unit (the smallest unit we can imagine) \nof X\n• Which decision is better? Check the marginal utilities.\n• But we have to consider that the prices are different.\n• Relative price indicates how much unit of Y can be exchanged with 1 more X.\n• Marginal utility per spending of X = marginal utility of X / price of X\nWhat is the optimal choice?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\nInitial point\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 1\n• Which decision is better? Comparing the marginal utilities per spending.\n• Suppose an initial state of X,Y . What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ? Can he/she better off (by changing in decision for \nX,Y)? Yes. Suppose that he/she get more X by giving up some Y . \n• What if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n ?\n• After all adjustments, we derive the rule of maximization \n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n= \n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\n• Note that there is no incentive to deviate from the equality condition.\nMarginal analysis\n: Intuition for the rule of maximization 2\n• Suppose that he/she starts to spend money from 0.\n• To make the best decision, he/she would choose the plan with a higher marginal utility per spending. For \nexample, if \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n> \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n, he/she will choose X.\n• Note that the marginal utility of one good decreases as he/she consume more. If he/she consume X more \nand more, \n𝑀𝑈𝑋\n𝑃𝑋\n< \n𝑀𝑈𝑌\n𝑃𝑌\n. In that case, he/she can get more utility by getting more Y and giving up some X.\n• That means, if he/she is rational, he/she will stick to the condition,\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n= \n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n.\nMarginal analysis\n: The rule of maximization\n• If there are other goods (which means, in more general terms),\n𝑴𝑼𝑿\n𝑷𝑿\n= \n𝑴𝑼𝒀\n𝑷𝒀\n= ⋯ = \n𝑴𝑼𝒁\n𝑷𝒁\n.\n• The rule of maximization captures several important characteristics of consumers in market economy.\n• The relationship among consumptions on different items.\n• The effect of price change\n• The effect of income change\n• How the shape of marginal utilities affect consumption plan (and how the consumption plan responses to income/price change)?",

        "Demand curve\n• What is demand curve? The relationship between price and quantity demanded\n• What is the quantity demanded? We know what occurs if consumers follow their self-interest. => The \noptimal decision of consumption\n• Remind that price effect is negative (-).\nThanks!!"

        "1. Budget Constraint\n• Suppose there is a consumer whose name is Pepe. He is the representative agent of all customers in our \nsociety.\n\n1. Budget Constraint\n• We want to capture that consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and \nwant.\n• Pepe has 5,600 wons in spending money each week.\n• He can allocate this spending between meal ticket and shirts. \n• The meal tickets cost 700 wons each, and the shirts are 1,400 wons each.\n\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Of course, the budget constraint diagram containing just two goods is not realistic. \n• Because, in a modern economy, people choose from thousands of goods.\n• However, thinking about a model with many goods can be just a straightforward extension of what we \ndiscussed here.\n• The point is that there is always a trade-off problem in decisions.\n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket\n8\n4\n• Each point on the line of \nbudget constraint \nrepresents a combination \nof meal tickets and shirts, \nwhich the total cost adds \nup to Pepe’s budget of \n5,600 won. \nClothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• If he spend out his budget, we can \nthink his budget constraint is actually \nthe outer line of the colored area.\n• If he had unlimited income or goods \nwere free, then he could consume \nwithout limit.  \n• Any point outside the constraint is \nnot affordable, because it would cost \nmore money than Pepe has in his \nbudget.\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• It just means that,\n𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒.\n• In this case,\n• Income = 5,600 wons\n• Expenditure = 700 M + 1,400 S\n• So, 5600 = 700𝑀 +1400𝑆\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• To draw it in a 2-D plane,\n➢5600 = 700M + 1400S\n➢700M = 5600 – 1400S\n➢M = 8 – 2S\nMeal ticket\n8\n4 Clothes\n1. Budget Constraint\n• The slope of the budget constraint is \ndetermined by the relative price. \n• Relative price - How many meal \ntickets would Pepe have to give up to \nget one more shirt, while staying \nwithin his budget?\n• All along the budget set, getting 1 \nshirt means giving up 2 meal tickets.\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• Economists call it opportunity cost.\n• Opportunity cost indicate what have to be given up to obtain something. In other words, opportunity cost \nis the value of the next best alternative.\n• For Pepe, the opportunity cost of 1 shirt is the 2 meal tickets. \n• He would decide to buy one more shirt, If the value of the extra shirt exceed the value of the alternative \n(2 meal tickets).\n1. Budget Constraint\n• A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost.\n• If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost might be the time which would be spent \nto make up the class.\n• If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. \n• In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price.\n• For example, attending graduate school is the case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. \nThe explicit costs of attending college might be about tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. \nBut in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a \npaying job. Thus, graduate school imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost \nearnings.\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if the price of a good changes?\n• Suppose that, the price of bus ticket increased to 1,400 won.\n• A price increase for bus tickets would have no effect on the ability to purchase Ramen. \n• But it would reduce the number of bus tickets which Pepe could afford to buy.\n• What happens in the budget constraint? Redraw it. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal ticket = 4 - Shirt\nMeal tickets\nShirts\n8\n4\n4\n1. Budget Constraint\n• What if Pepe’s income changes?\n• Suppose that, his income drops as a half(=2,800 won).\n• In this case, it would reduce the number of both of meal tickets and shirts which Pepe could afford to buy. \n1. Budget Constraint\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4\n4\n2\n1. Budget Constraint\n•What if Pepe’s \nincome is \nexpanded?\nMeal tickets\nClothes\n8\n4",
        "2. Utility\n• People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility from using those goods and services.\n• Utility is the term which economists use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction/usefulness or \nhappiness with his or her choices.\n• Of course, in our daily life, we don’t measure such a thing. But, in model, it can be a quite useful \ninstrument to replicate the underlying incentive structure of each individuals.\n2. Utility\nEconomists assume the feature of utility\n1.The more of some good one consumes, the more utility \none obtains.\n2. As a person consumes more of a good, the additional (or \nmarginal) utility from each additional unit of the good \ndeclines.\n2. Utility\n• It is a general pattern that consumption of the first few units of good tends to bring a higher level of \nutility than consumption of later units.\n• Suppose that you are in thirsty. You can compare the degree to which the first few drops of water relieve \nthe thirst and the extent to which the drinking water later resolves the thirst.\n• Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility.\n• It means that, the utility of a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more \nthan the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.\n2. Utility\n• The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing \nchoices. \n• Most of people would not say, “My favorite food is potato, so I will eat nothing but only potatoes from \nnow on.”\n• Even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the marginal \nutility from those last few servings would not be very high. \n2. Utility\n• An example for the marginal utilities for meal ticket (and shirt):\n𝑀𝑈𝑀 = 1\n𝑀\n𝑀𝑈𝑆 = 1\n𝑆",
